Analyze the performance of the spacecraft and how it differs from the desired result. Be guided by the scoring system. Identify the cause of errors in your code and modify it without fear of making major changes. Think deeply about the priorities of your code and how to order and combine them correctly to achieve success. Remember that the code is a reflection of your reasoning and the way you approach the problem.

Razonamiento:
In the task of landing a spacecraft, each component of the current observation array plays a vital role in understanding its condition. Here is an analysis of each observation and the observed effects of actions taken:

**Observations:**
1. `X position`: The horizontal position of the spacecraft relative to the landing zone. Values close to 0 indicate that the spacecraft is near the landing zone horizontally.
2. `Y position`: The vertical position of the spacecraft relative to the landing zone. A value of 0 indicates that the spacecraft has reached ground level.
3. `X velocity`: The horizontal velocity of the spacecraft. A smaller absolute value (close to 0) indicates that the spacecraft is moving slower horizontally, which is ideal for a safe landing.
4. `Y velocity`: The vertical velocity of the spacecraft. Negative values represent a downward motion. A smaller absolute value is also preferable here.
5. `Angle`: The angle of the spacecraft relative to vertical. The ideal landing angle is 0.
6. `Angular velocity`: The rate of change of the angle of the spacecraft. Lower values are better for stability.
7. `Left contact sensor`: Indicates whether the left side of the spacecraft is in contact with the landing zone.
8. `Right contact sensor`: Indicates whether the right side of the spacecraft is in contact with the landing zone.

**Actions and their effects:**
1. `Action 0`: Switch off engines. The spacecraft will continue to move according to its current velocities without adjustment.
2. `Action 1`: Push left engine. This action helps to reduce leftward movement and adjust the spacecraft‚Äôs angle.
3. `Action 2`: Push both engines (upwards). This action reduces the downward velocity and can also help stabilize horizontal movement.
4. `Action 3`: Push right engine. This action reduces rightward movement and adjusts the spacecraft‚Äôs angle.

**Steps to achieve successful landing:**
1. Maintain Y velocity close to 0 for a soft landing.
2. Reduce horizontal velocity to minimize drift away from the landing zone.
3. Keep the spacecraft's angle close to 0 to ensure a stable landing.
4. Utilize engines sparingly as continuous firing reduces the score.
5. Continuously monitor the X and Y positions to ensure the spacecraft is approaching the landing zone correctly.

**Code Adjustments:** To make the landing more effective, focus on actions 1 and 3 to control drift and angle, and use action 2 sparingly to reduce Y velocity. The goal is to adjust the function to make more calculated decisions based on the current state observations.

Razonamiento:
To achieve a successful landing, we need to analyze the observations and understand the impact of each action on the status of the spacecraft. The key observations include X and Y positions, X and Y velocities, angle, and angular velocity. The desired outcome is to land with minimum horizontal and vertical velocities, a small angle, and no angular velocity. Each of the actions affects these observations as follows:

1. **Switch off engines (0)**: Halts any current thrust application leading to a natural descent due to gravity, with gradual increases in vertical velocity and stabilization of horizontal velocity.
2. **Push left engine (1)**: Applies thrust from the left engine, which adjusts the X velocity (usually decreasing rightward movement or increasing leftward movement) and introduces torque that changes the angle (making it tilt to the right) and angular velocity.
3. **Push both engines (2)**: This action provides an upward thrust that decreases Y velocity (slows descent or initiates an ascent), and can stabilize the vertical velocity. This action is more fuel-consuming as it involves both engines.
4. **Push right engine (3)**: Opposite to action 1, this thrust decreases leftward movement or increases rightward movement, with torque adjusting the angle to tilt left and an increase in angular velocity.

In successful landings, certain patterns are identified:
- Frequent use of action 2 (push both engines) to manage descent speed.
- Minimal angular deviations managed through actions 1 and 3 alternately to stabilize the angle around 0.
- Controlling horizontal drift by adjusting X position through actions 1 and 3 as necessary, while gradually approaching (0, 0) coordinates.
- Limiting vertical velocity to avoid harsh landings while carefully managing fuel consumption to avoid score penalties.

To implement this, we can create a decision logic in the `act` method to continuously check the observations and accordingly decide the next action. This logic will involve prioritizing actions that stabilize the angle, maintain low velocities, and bring the spacecraft closer to the landing zone. The code will be updated to dynamically adjust actions based on the current status observations to optimize scores and ensure successful landing.

Razonamiento:
The last code provided achieved the best result of -474.946 by focusing on the main aspects of the spacecraft landing. Below is a comparison and analysis between the previous code and the best result:

- **Horizontal Movement Adjustment**: The previous attempts were not adequately adjusting for X position and X velocity. The best code adjusts the horizontal movement if both the position and velocity exceed certain thresholds.

- **Vertical Control**: The best code emphasizes maintaining vertical control by checking for significant negative Y velocity. When Y velocity drops below -0.3 or when the Y position is more than 0.1 with a slight downward velocity, it fires both engines.

- **Angle Control**: The best code adjusts for angular errors more conservatively. It checks both the angle and angular velocity before deciding to push the left or right engine.

- **Landing Detection**: Both codes detect successful landing by checking the left_contact and right_contact variables.

From the analysis, I deduced that the best code prioritizes stabilizing the spacecraft before descent begins, correcting both horizontal drift and angular errors, and then maintaining vertical control during the descent. I'll enhance the previous function by adding granular checking of the conditions and a more structured approach to prioritize actions to prevent crashes.

Implementing these findings, here's an improved code version:

Analyze the performance of the spacecraft and how it differs from the desired result. Be guided by the scoring system. Identify the cause of errors in your code and modify it without fear of making major changes. Think deeply about the priorities of your code and how to order and combine them correctly to achieve success. Remember that the code is a reflection of your reasoning and the way you approach the problem.

Razonamiento:
From the logs, the spacecraft consistently failed to stabilize, maintain its velocity, and control its angle, leading to a crash with a significant negative score. The key areas needing improvement involve ensuring horizontal and vertical velocities are reduced to safe levels and maintaining a stable angle throughout the descent. Here are the steps and rationale for modifying the code:

1. **Control the descent (Y velocity):** Action 2 (push both engines) needs to be used more judiciously to manage the descent speed effectively.
2. **Stabilize horizontal movement (X velocity):** Actions 1 and 3 (push left/right engines) should be used to correct horizontal drift and maintain a central position over the landing zone.
3. **Maintain vertical orientation (angle control):** Adjust angle using actions 1 and 3 to keep it close to zero, ensuring stable descent.
4. **Reduce reliance on continuous engine thrust:** Avoid unnecessary firings to maintain score.

**Revised Code Strategy: **
- Handle each condition (velocity, position, angle) carefully and prioritize stabilizing the spacecraft using minimal necessary engine thrust.
- Adjust actions dynamically based on the current state, ensuring that corrections are balanced.

Here is the revised code with changes implemented into the `act` function:

Razonamiento:
After analyzing both codes and their respective performances, it is evident that the best-scoring code leverages the observation values more effectively to make decisions. The priorities include managing both horizontal (X) and vertical (Y) velocities, correcting the angle, and ensuring smooth landing by reducing velocities. This example shows that the spacecraft needs constant adjustments in both horizontal and vertical movements and angle orientation to facilitate a successful landing, considering critical conditions like velocities and angles.

To improve the performance of the spacecraft landing, the following incremental improvements can be implemented:
1. **Horizontal Movement Correction**: Adjust horizontal displacement by controlling the side engines, ensuring the X position is closer to 0 with minimal X velocity.
2. **Vertical Movement and Descent Control**: Regulate Y velocity by using both engines to decelerate the descent when too fast.
3. **Angle Adjustment**: Correct angular deviations based on angle and angular velocity.
4. **Landing Detection**: Once the ship lands (both contacts), engines should be switched off.

This integrated approach organizes priorities effectively and adjusts based on the severity of the condition, hence moderately improving the decision-making process of the act function.

Razonamiento:
The latest code which achieved a score of -233.267 allows us to review its strategy:

- The code focuses on correcting the horizontal position and velocity immediately if any threshold is crossed.
- Then, it checks for vertical velocity and ensures upward thrust if the spacecraft is descending too quickly.
- Lastly, the code focuses on correcting the angle, allowing action to be taken if even the angle or angular velocity exceeds thresholds.
- The conditions are ordered to prioritize horizontal stability, followed by vertical descent control, and finally angle correction. 

From the given results, it's evident that prioritizing horizontal adjustment initially, followed by vertical control and angle correction, leads to a more stable descent trajectory towards landing. 

Let's combine these identified strategies correctly to improve our code.

Razonamiento:
The performance of the spacecraft in the latest logs indicates multiple inefficiencies in handling the descent and maintaining stability of movement. Further analysis shows that continuous vertical and horizontal thrusting was not optimal. A comparison between the provided code and mine reveals key insights and opportunities for improvement.

**Comparison and Issues:**
1. **Horizontal Control:** Both implementations handle horizontal control using positions and velocities, but the provided code had simpler checks (`> 0.1 or < -0.1`) compared to my use of excess velocities (`> 0.1 or < -0.1`). Incorporating both checks helps more accurately account for drift and position.
2. **Vertical Control:** The provided code more simply manages descent speed. My implementation overused action `1` and failed to control `Y` and `angle` as tightly, leading to a crash. Maintaining thresholds and logical checks by combining heights and velocity offers a balance needed for smoother descent.
3. **Angle Control:** Constant adjustments of angles and angular speed may seem redundant. Incorporating a focused but wider threshold (`> 0.1 or < -0.1`) within manageable ranges will provide streamlined corrections.

**Revised Strategy and Code:** To try a combined approach by rectifying discussed differences, here are the revisited steps:
1. Emphasize stable horizontal position and velocity adjustments through joint checks.
2. Prioritize vertical speed through cautiously timed thrusts (action 2) balancing `Y_pos` and `Y_vel` conditions.
3. Simplify angle alongside horizontal stability, circumventing redundant actions within threshold ranges.

This hybrid gameplan targets the most accurate and stabilized descent trajectory possible.

Razonamiento:
The logs indicate the spacecraft experienced escalating issues primarily with horizontal displacement, angle mismanagement, and rapid accumulation of multiple penalizing conditions resulting in poor scoring and eventual crash. Here‚Äôs a detailed analysis guiding through a refined approach:

1. **Horizontal Movement Control**: If horizontal movement veers too far off-center or operates at high velocity, employ side engines to rectify.
2. **Vertical Descent Management**: Prioritize decelerating descent speed if it's excessively high; use main engines sparingly to avoid fuel penalties.
3. **Angular Correction**: Ensure minimal angle around zero for stable descent, adjusting with side engines if deviations occur.
4. **General Stability**: Continuously maintain velocity and angular stability, freezing actions (engines off) if conditions stabilize locally.
5. **Contact-Landing Handling**: Upon contact (both left and right), switch off engines to preserve stability.

Refinement involves systematic priorities: primary stability correction (angle and velocity corrections), secondary stabilization spans adjusting horizontal displacement, and minimizing unnecessary engine use. This hierarchy establishes balanced thrust engagement based on state observations for optimal descent control and environment-adaptive responsiveness.

Razonamiento:
The highest-scoring code provided highlights several key decisions and modifications that guided the spacecraft with better results. Here is a detailed analysis of the main points and a revised version based on observations:

1. **Immediate Horizontal Adjustment**: The code immediately adjusts for horizontal drift, either position or velocity exceeding certain thresholds. This is effective in keeping the spacecraft centered.
2. **Vertical Descent Control**: The vertical velocity is kept in check to prevent rapid descents that could lead to crashes. The action of pushing both engines upwards is correctly prioritized for reducing high negative Y velocities.
3. **Angle Stability**: The angle and angular velocity are controlled to ensure the spacecraft maintains a stable orientation, essential for a balanced descent.
4. **Reduced Oscillations**: By checking and responding to the conditions as they arise, the code methodically reduces excessive oscillations or erratic behavior.
5. **Action Duplication and Adjustments**: Firing actions repeatedly for stabilization is key. If immediate stabilization doesn't occur, the repeated actions ensure it progressively corrects the deviations.

Variations on initial conditions require possible step-by-step fine tuning based on observed performance metrics like score, Y velocity, horizontal position, X velocity, angle, and angular adjustments until landing.

The code below is revised to consider these priorities and designed to balance the conditions effectively:

Razonamiento:
Let's carefully analyze logs and comparisons to generate a comprehensive understanding and guide code optimization toward performing well as expected.

### Analysis of the Provided Code
**Key Strengths: **
1. **Consistent Checking:** The constants and structured observation indices enhance readability, ensuring the thresholds are applied efficiently without deviations or misinterpretations.
2. **Action Prioritization:** The code priorities are clear ‚Äì by first focusing on horizontal and vertical positional/stability maneuvers and maintaining descent, it emphasizes control at key areas.
3. **Simplified Implementations:** By employing straightforward checks (`> 0.1 or < -0.1`), it avoids unnecessary complexity in adjustments, showing clarity in critical decision triggers.

### Comparative Analysis and Potential Improvements
**Observations on Differences:**
1. **Horizontal Adjustments & Angle:** More precise synchronous control elements might be needed to correct nuances not fully leveraged or simplified in prior versions.
2. **Descent Maneuver Transition:** Ensuring a balanced approach while not overthrusting upward mobility (`Action 2`) allows for more manageable control in dynamic changes.
3. **Efficient Trigger Transitions:** Differences in thresholds must be correctly prioritized ‚Äì for instance, minor yet effective adjustments for `X velocity`, `Y velocity`, `angle`, and `vertical descent` harmonize for accurate responsive management.

**Goal:** Elevate code efficiency by deliberately structuring conditions for seamless integration in needful flight maneuvering. A hybrid recombination strategy secures readiness to correct deviations quickly.

Razonamiento:
After comparing the provided best result code with the previous attempt, the crucial differences are noted in structured parameter thresholds and a clear separation of decision logic for prioritizing stabilizations. Adjustments targeting distinct parameter observations and specific conditions ensure explicit control over horizontal, vertical, and angular dynamics. The current state needs adjustments to integrate lessons learned, ensuring responsive controls aligning with best practices.

Key Adjustments Include:
1. **Explicit Threshold Definitions**: Incorporate constants for often-used values to streamline the threshold adjustments as required.
2. **Index Labels for Observations**: Define clear indices mapping observation arrays for improved maintainability and readability.
3. **Prioritized Condition Handling**: Sequentially address horizontal and vertical motions followed by angular corrections, focusing on stability.
4. **Auto-Balance Logic**: Enforce control corrections incrementally enhancing stability until touchdown.

The following code reflects these enhancements, embedding refined decision structures and thresholds explanation for optimal performance:

Razonamiento:
The latest performance with a total score of -233.267 indicates that the spacecraft crashes despite making efforts to control horizontal, vertical, and angular movements progressively.

Analyzing crashes and performance, the spacecraft‚Äôs consistent horizontal control at the start leads to better scores, but it fails to handle the vertical descent and angular stability effectively, leading to crashes.

1. **Too Many Repeated Left Engine Pushes**: We have repeated pushes from the left engine which needed gradual progressions.
2. **Angular Control**: The angular adjustments came too late and persisted when unnecessary, causing compounding errors.
3. **Vertical Stability Mismanagement**: Both engine offs and upward pushes didn't fit effective progression, which worsened vertical handling.

### Revised Strategy and Code
- Start with immediate adjustments for horizontal, followed by vertical, and step-by-step corrections for angle and angular velocity.
- Add break-points if conditions stabilize or progressively improve in steps, ensuring effective descent.

Linked actions more closely to corresponding observed conditions, avoiding redundant pushes.

Here is the revised code:

Razonamiento:
Analyzing both the provided `best result` code and the latest implementation reveals several patterns and behaviors impacting the spacecraft‚Äôs descent and stability. To improve upon our approach, it‚Äôs crucial to identify what worked well and where it failed.

In the logs generated by the recent iterations, the spacecraft starts with correct maneuvers involving core vertical and horizontal adjustments but eventually becomes overly reliant on a single action, particularly pushing the left engine (Action 1). This causes the spacecraft to spiral out of control as it heavily tilts to one side and consistently fires to unstable angular movements in one direction.

Steps to Improve:
1. **Balanced Action Deployment:** Alternate and balance engine thrusts to avoid overcompensation or a single directional tilt. Improve responsiveness while avoiding long sequences of similar actions.
2. **Decelerative vs. Corrective Thresholding:** Prioritize gentle, precision-driven control changes in response to smaller deviations in X/Y velocities and angles simultaneously, ensuring maneuvers are not extreme but rather stabilizing smoothly incrementally.
3. **Adaptive and Time-step Adjustments:** Incorporate state-checking periodically for correction across actions dynamically, and adapt cross-thresholds for detecting errors and toggling maneuvering responses accurately.

Revised Comprehensive Code:** Below is the revamped implementation function melding these detailed insights for an improved landing mechanism:

Razonamiento:
Upon comparison, it is clear that the best-performing code effectively sets thresholds and explicitly handles each observation. The specific thresholds and observation indices greatly aid in maintaining the control logic. The key takeaway is to manage control efficiency by handling X and Y movements, angle, and angular velocities separately and prioritize their corrections. The concise and clear logic structure helps in maintaining stability during descent and landing.

The main areas of improvement for the act function involve:
1. Managing horizontal movement effectively by adjusting to required thrust based on X position and velocity.
2. Controlling vertical velocity to manage descent speed effectively, especially under fast falling conditions.
3. Correcting the angle and minimizing angular velocity for a stable descent.
4. Implementing structured condition checks that sequentially handle the observations and return corresponding actions.
5. Ensuring minimal engine usage when conditions are stable to avoid fuel penalties and focusing on descent efficiency.

Integrating these improvements involves setting and adjusting thresholds proportionally, ensuring clear observation handling, and simplifying decision-making logic based on the defined priorities.

Razonamiento:
To achieve a successful landing, we need to monitor and control various aspects of the spacecraft‚Äôs status. These parameters include X and Y positions (horizontal and vertical position relative to the landing zone), velocities (both horizontal and vertical), angle, and angular velocity.

Key factors for a successful landing based on the logs provided:

1. **Horizontal and Vertical Position (X, Y Position):** The spacecraft needs to be close to the landing area, ideally within a small distance horizontally. Vertical descent should be smooth without immediate sharp drops.

2. **Velocities (X, Y Velocity):** Both horizontal and vertical velocities should be minimal. High velocities can result in a crash. Vertical velocity should reduce as the spacecraft gets closer to the landing zone.

3. **Angle and Angular Velocity:** The spacecraft should ideally have zero tilt (angle = 0) and minimal angular velocity. Tilting and rotating at high speeds can destabilize the landing.

4. **Engines usage:** Usage of engines influences the movement and scores. Misusing engines can lead to negative scores. Avoid overusing non-central engines.

### Actions‚Äô Influence:

1. **Action 0 (Switch off engines):** No thrust. The spacecraft behaves naturally under gravity and inertia. Use this to conserve fuel and maintain control when in a stable position.

2. **Action 1 (Push left engine):** This action causes the spacecraft to gain a rightward horizontal velocity and can counter an excessive leftward drift. However, it can increase angular velocity and tilt.

3. **Action 2 (Push both engines upwards):** Provides upward thrust, countering gravity‚Äôs pull, and reducing vertical velocity. It‚Äôs pivotal when reducing descent speed.

4. **Action 3 (Push right engine):** This results in gain of leftward horizontal velocity. Helps in balancing rightward drift but impacts angular velocity.

### Steps for Successful Landing:
1. **Initial Control:** Monitor initial velocity and position. For high initial horizontal velocity, reduce it using opposite side engines (1 or 3 depending on the direction). For high vertical velocity, use Action 2 to gain upward thrust.

2. **Mid-Air Corrections:** Consistently adjust horizontal velocity towards 0 using appropriate side engines. Simultaneously, manage descent speed using upward thrust.

3. **Pre-Landing Adjustments:** As you get closer to the landing area (lower Y position), your actions should focus on maintaining minimal horizontal velocity and reducing vertical velocity. Ensure minimal tilt and low angular velocities.

4. **Final Approach and Touchdown:** In the final stages (near zero Y position), focus on achieving a near-zero vertical velocity by using Action 2. Correct any slight drifts with minimal lateral thrust and ensure the spacecraft is upright.

### Code Implementation in Python to follow these steps:
```python
import numpy as np

def act(observation):
    X_pos, Y_pos, X_vel, Y_vel, angle, angular_velocity, left_contact, right_contact = observation
    
    # Condition-specific Actions
    if Y_vel < -0.3:
        return 2  # Push both engines (Upwards) to reduce descending speed
    elif abs(angle) > 0.1:
        if angle > 0:
            return 1 # Push left engine to correct right tilt
        else:
            return 3 # Push right engine to correct left tilt
    elif abs(X_vel) > 0.2:
        if X_vel > 0:
            return 1 # Push left engine to correct right drift
        else:
            return 3 # Push right engine to correct left drift
    else:
        return 0  # Switch off engines if all conditions are within safe bounds
```

Razonamiento:
The primary objective for a successful landing is to ensure the spacecraft settles at coordinates close to (0,0) with minimal velocities (both horizontal and vertical), minimal angle tilting, and no engine firings upon touching down to avoid point deductions and potential crashes. The key observations to monitor are: 

1. Horizontal Position (`X position`): Should be near to 0.
2. Vertical Position (`Y position`): Should smoothly decrease to 0.
3. Horizontal Velocity (`X velocity`): Should be close to 0 when approaching landing to avoid drifting horizontally.
4. Vertical Velocity (`Y velocity`): Should be close to 0 to ensure a soft landing.
5. Angle (`Angle`): Should be close to 0 to ensure the spacecraft is upright.
6. Angular Velocity (`Angular velocity`): Should be minimal to avoid rotational instability.
7. Left & Right Contact Sensors: Should indicate that the spacecraft is in contact with the landing zone on both legs simultaneously at the final landing stage.

Actions and their effects:
1. Action 0: Switch off engines ‚Äì no thrusters are firing; used to conserve fuel and avoid unnecessary velocity changes.
2. Action 1: Push left engine ‚Äì causes a rightward thrust and left rotation; useful for adjusting horizontal position and angle.
3. Action 2: Push both engines (upwards) ‚Äì provides upward thrust; useful for reducing vertical descent speed or correcting descent path.
4. Action 3: Push right engine ‚Äì causes a leftward thrust and right rotation; similar to action 1 but in the opposite direction.

Steps to follow to achieve a successful landing:
1. Monitor horizontal and vertical velocities. Use actions 1 and 3 to adjust horizontal drift and angle direction. Use action 2 to reduce vertical speed when needed.
2. Avoid large angles; maintain the spacecraft vertically aligned by correcting angles using actions 1 and 3 carefully.
3. As the spacecraft gets closer to the ground, ensure minimal horizontal and vertical velocities for a soft landing without crash.
4. Switch off engines (action 0) once in contact with the ground and speeds are minimal to avoid further propulsion that may cause an imbalance or crash.
5. Iterate these controls with fine adjustments based on real-time observations, ensuring the spacecraft remains stable, upright, and descends gently.

Razonamiento:
From the records, we observe several factors that influence the score. First, for successful landings, the X position and velocity must be minimized to stay centered over the landing zone. Likewise, the Y velocity should be kept low to ensure a soft landing, while the angle and angular velocity should be close to zero to ensure a vertical descent. The usage of engines also affects the score due to the fuel penalty and how it alters the trajectory and speed.

Correcting the trajectory by using side engines only when necessary, while utilizing the center engine to decrease Y velocity closer to the ground, are key steps.

Steps to achieve a successful landing:
1. Correct horizontal velocity (X velocity) to near zero using side engines early in the descent.
2. Manage vertical velocity (Y velocity) by controlling the thrust of the main engine as the spacecraft approaches the landing zone (decrease steadily as the spacecraft gets closer to the ground).
3. Maintain a minimal angle with respect to the vertical, especially near landing.
4. Use fewer engines when less correction is needed (balance fuel penalties and correction benefits).
5. Avoid corrections that cause sudden large changes in the spacecraft's current variables, especially closer to the ground.
6. Use a finer control of the thrust as the spacecraft's altitude decreases to ensure a gentle landing.

The Python code for the 'act' method is structured to achieve these targets based on the inputs from the environment.

### Step-by-Step Analysis and Reasoning
1. **Initial Observation Analysis**
   - Each time step represents the state of the environment and the spacecraft: 
     - X and Y positions show horizontal and vertical position.
     - X and Y velocities show horizontal and vertical speed.
     - Angle and Angular velocity show current tilt and how fast the spacecraft is rotating.
     - Contact sensors indicate if the left or right side of the spacecraft is in contact with the ground.
   - The scoring system penalizes the spacecraft‚Äôs position relative to the landing zone, speed, tilt, and engine firing.
2. **Action Effects**
   - `0 Switch off engines`: allows natural motion with gravity and inertia, no engine penalty but may need corrections.
   - `1 Push left engine`: applies a counter-clockwise torque, useful when the spacecraft tilts right, slight horizontal shift to the right.
   - `2 Push both engines (upwards)`: reduces vertical speed, necessary for controlled descents, major engine penalty.
   - `3 Push right engine`: applies a clockwise torque, useful when the spacecraft tilts left, slight horizontal shift to the left.
3. **Steps to Successful Landing**
   - **Initial Stability**: Reduce high velocities and correct major angles using selective left or right engines.
   - **Controlled Descent**: Fire the center engine intermittently to reduce vertical speed while ensuring the spacecraft stays close to the landing zone horizontally.
   - **Fine Tuning**: Adjust angles and velocities precisely before contacting the ground to avoid crashes.
4. **Function Improvement Strategy**
   - Evaluate angles and apply left/right engine corrections immediately if necessary.
   - Control vertical and horizontal velocities using the center engine strategically.
   - Emphasize minimal engine usage to avoid excessive penalties.

### Learning and Implementation
1. **Modify `act` function to focus on minimizing penalties**
2. **Adjust engine actions based on precise conditions of position and velocities**

Razonamiento:
By comparing the best result obtained (-28.834) with the previous attempt, we can understand where improvements are needed and analyze the differences to refine the strategy.

### Key Observations:
1. **Angle Control:** The best result script prioritized angle control much better. If the angle deviates significantly, it uses side engines to stabilize. This avoids increasing angular velocity and maintains overall stability.

2. **Vertical and Horizontal Speed Control:** Effective control of vertical and horizontal speeds was prioritized by firing the main engine or side engines as required. The best result was achieved by limiting these velocities and focusing on reducing them gradually rather than instantaneously.

3. **Minimal Tilting and Angular Velocity:** Monitoring and correcting tilt (angle) and angular velocity. Using a tolerance to maintain within safe angular limits to ensure smooth landing.

### Key Differences and Improvements Required:
1. **Efficient Use of Engines:** Firing the right engine at the right time is critical. Overuse leads to excessive adjustment difficulties. The best result appropriately used engines with careful discretion to maintain control.

2. **Conservative Thrusting:** Avoid applying thrust too frequently in the same direction. Use thrusts to correct deviation but switch off engines to let the spacecraft stabilize naturally after corrections.

3. **Combining Actions Appropriately:** Actions must be condition-based and prioritize stability before speed adjustments. This means controlling angular behavior first and then adjusting vertical/horizontal speeds systematically.

### Modified Code Implementation:
```python
import math

# Constants for safe landing
SAFE_HORIZONTAL_SPEED = 0.2
SAFE_VERTICAL_SPEED = 0.4
SAFE_ANGLE = 0.1

# Control gains
ANGLE_TOLERANCE = math.radians(5)
VEL_TOLERANCE = 0.1

# Helper function to decide if action is needed

def should_fire_side_engines(angle):
    return abs(angle) > ANGLE_TOLERANCE

 def act(observation):
    x_pos, y_pos, x_vel, y_vel, angle, ang_vel, left_contact, right_contact = observation
    
    # Stabilize the angle first
    if should_fire_side_engines(angle) or abs(ang_vel) > ANGLE_TOLERANCE:
        if angle < 0:
            return 1  # Fire left engine
        else:
            return 3  # Fire right engine
    # Control vertical speed
    if y_vel < -SAFE_VERTICAL_SPEED:
        return 2  # Fire main engine to reduce vertical speed
    # Control horizontal speed
    if abs(x_vel) > SAFE_HORIZONTAL_SPEED:
        if x_vel > 0:
            return 1  # Fire left engine to reduce horizontal speed
        else:
            return 3  # Fire right engine to reduce horizontal speed
    # In case spacecraft is too tilted
    if abs(angle) > SAFE_ANGLE:
        if angle > 0:
            return 1  # Fire left engine
        else:
            return 3  # Fire right engine
    # Fire in case vertical speed is slow but you need positioning
    if abs(x_pos) > SAFE_HORIZONTAL_SPEED:
        if x_pos < 0:
            return 3  # Fire right engine to lurch left
        else:
            return 1  # Fire left engine to lurch right
    return 0  # Default action: turn off engines
```
This script rationally steps through the conditions and applies corrections systematically. It prioritizes handling deviations in angles and velocities while ensuring engines are used judiciously to avoid overcorrection.

By addressing earlier inefficiencies and adopting a focused, condition-based approach, the strategy improves stability and control to achieve better results consistently.

Razonamiento:
The purpose is to refine the action function to achieve a successful landing by maintaining a safe angle, vertical and horizontal velocities, and position. To do so, we need a structured approach to handle tilt first, then vertical speed, and horizontal speed. Additionally, the handling must be cautious to avoid overuse of engines. Let's reimplement the code with proper indentation and logical flow for checks and actions.

### Actions and Corresponding Conditions:
1. **Angle Control:** Angle deviation should be prioritized first. If the angle is beyond the tolerance, fire side engines to stabilize it.
2. **Vertical Speed Control:** If the descent speed is too high, use the main engine to slow down.
3. **Horizontal Speed Control:** Control lateral drift by using side engines correspondingly.
4. **Positional Adjustments:** Make positional corrections to secure the landing around the target zone.

Stylistically, the importance is on the sequential control of different parameters, prioritizing stability before positional corrections.

### Final Code:
```python
import math

# Constants for safe landing
SAFE_HORIZONTAL_SPEED = 0.2
SAFE_VERTICAL_SPEED = 0.4
SAFE_ANGLE = 0.1

# Control gains
ANGLE_TOLERANCE = math.radians(5)
VEL_TOLERANCE = 0.1

# Helper function to decide if action is needed

def should_fire_side_engines(angle):
    return abs(angle) > ANGLE_TOLERANCE

# Main function to decide action based on observation

def act(observation):
    x_pos, y_pos, x_vel, y_vel, angle, ang_vel, left_contact, right_contact = observation
    
    # Stabilize the angle first
    if should_fire_side_engines(angle) or abs(ang_vel) > ANGLE_TOLERANCE:
        if angle < 0:
            return 1  # Fire left engine
        else:
            return 3  # Fire right engine
    
    # Control vertical speed
    if y_vel < -SAFE_VERTICAL_SPEED:
        return 2  # Fire main engine to reduce vertical speed

    # Control horizontal speed
    if abs(x_vel) > SAFE_HORIZONTAL_SPEED:
        if x_vel > 0:
            return 1  # Fire left engine to reduce horizontal speed
        else:
            return 3  # Fire right engine to reduce horizontal speed

    # In case spacecraft is too tilted
    if abs(angle) > SAFE_ANGLE:
        if angle > 0:
            return 1  # Fire left engine
        else:
            return 3  # Fire right engine

    # Fire in case vertical speed is slow but you need positioning
    if abs(x_pos) > SAFE_HORIZONTAL_SPEED:
        if x_pos < 0:
            return 3  # Fire right engine to lurch left
        else:
            return 1  # Fire left engine to lurch right
    
    return 0  # Default action: turn off engines

Analyze the performance of the spacecraft and how it differs from the desired result. Be guided by the scoring system. Identify the cause of errors in your code and modify it without fear of making major changes. Think deeply about the priorities of your code and how to order and combine them correctly to achieve success. Remember that the code is a reflection of your reasoning and the way you approach the problem.

Razonamiento:
By comparing the best-performing code and logs with my previous implementation, I've identified the following areas of improvement:

1. Speed Control: The best-performing code manages both horizontal and vertical velocities more effectively. It closely monitors these velocities and fires the main engine or side engines as needed to keep them within a safe range.

2. Angle Control: The judgement parameters for stabilizing the angle are set more optimally. The addition of a function to determine whether the side engines should be fired based on the angle helps stabilize the spacecraft more effectively.

3. Fine Tuning: The control gains and tolerances for decision making are finely tuned to ensure the spacecraft remains stable during descent. 

4. Action Responses: The best-performing code uses both engines (action 2) more strategically to slow down the vertical descent and to adjust the horizontal position by reducing the drift.

5. Crisp Conditions: The conditions set for engine burns are crisper and more goal-oriented, particularly focusing on preventing crashes by maintaining parameters within safe ranges.

I'll rewrite the code incorporating these insights while keeping the structure of the best-performing code, but I'll be sure to add my nuanced observations and adjustments for a more balanced implementation. The changes will be oriented towards creating a finer control over velocity, angle, and drift corrections with higher priority actions to minimize score penalties.

Razonamiento:
The previously shared code performs better in controlling the spacecraft. It uses a more systematic approach to controlling the angle, velocity, and position. However, there are several improvements to be made and insights to be derived from the better-performing script:
1. **Control Horizontal Speed Early**: The previous script applied horizontal control mildly, leading to accumulating penalties. Additionally, maintaining horizontal position near the zero level throughout the trajectory is more advantageous.
2. **Vertical Speed Control**: Earlier control on vertical speed before the craft is too close to the ground is essential, avoiding large bursts of speed near the end.
3. **Angle Control Precision**: Keeping the angle continuously aligned and stabilizing from the correction bursts earlier.
4. **Engine Decisions Not Constant**: The better script employs side engines in bursts rather than constantly checking and adjusting vertical velocities.

Based on these insights, here is the improved code with better control over each parameter.

Key Steps and Adjustments in Revised Code:
1. Initialize checks/functions for angle, rate of descent adjustments, and horizontal correction in priority order.
2. Apply corrective actions more decisively and timely to avoid penalties accumulating over time.
3. Fine-tune the logic to use engines more efficiently and appropriately based on changing conditions without over-corrections.
4. Reduce horizontal and vertical speeds earlier and maintain minimal angular deviation.

Razonamiento:
### Performance Analysis
1. **Initial Stages**: Initially, the spacecraft seemed to perform fairly well, with positive scores. This indicates that early stabilizing movements were effective.
2. **Mid Stages**: As the descent progressed, there were fluctuations in scores influenced largely by incorrect engine firing strategies leading to speed and angle mismanagement.
3. **Late Stages**: A mix of stabilizing actions and inaccuracies in managing both speed and angle resulted in more score penalties, eventually leading to a crash.
4. **Specific Issues**:
   - Overuse of side engines without significant correction of angles.
   - Intermittent usage of the center engine which disrupted steady descent.
   - Delay in correcting excessive vertical and horizontal velocities.

### Identified Causes
1. **Overcorrection**: Frequent use of left and right engines without substantial improvement in angle or velocity adjustments.
2. **Insufficient Vertical Speed Control**: Pushing the center engine was not utilized enough to slow down rapidly enough, resulting in persistent high vertical velocities.
3. **Management of Angles and Angular Velocities**: Often the side engines were fired in alternation disrupting rather than stabilizing the angle.
4. **Frame-wise Decision Making**: Implementing a strategic combination of angle adjustment and speed adjustments wasn't properly implemented.

### Revised Strategy for Landing
1. **Primary Focus: Vertical Speed**: Ensure the center engine is actively managing vertical speed to stay within safe limits.
2. **Secondary Focus: Angle Correction**: Use side engines to maintain safe angles and angular velocities.
3. **Tertiary Focus: Horizontal Speed Control**: Adjust for minor horizontal speed anomalies as needed.
4. **Incremental Adjustments**: Move to minimal engine usage to fine-tune as the craft approaches the landing area.

Razonamiento:
The provided logs reveal that the last code consistently fires the engines in an alternating fashion, leading to oscillations and ultimately higher deviations in both horizontal and vertical speeds. To stabilize the lander better:

### Key Issues and Improvements Needed:
1. **Reduce Oscillations:** Avoid rapid alternation in engine usage. Engines should be fired for corrections, and then give the system time to stabilize.

2. **Stronger Angle Control:** Stabilizing the angle should have the highest priority since an unstable angle affects other parameters.

3. **Gradual Speed Adjustments:** Vertical and horizontal speeds should be controlled to slow descent and drift gradually without causing large oscillations.

4. **Sequential Safety Checks:** Order of operations should reflect branching conditions so that corrections occur sequentially, improving stability.

### Modified Code with Prioritized Safety Checks:
```python
import math

# Constants for safe landing
SAFE_HORIZONTAL_SPEED = 0.2
SAFE_VERTICAL_SPEED = 0.4
SAFE_ANGLE = 0.1

# Control gains
ANGLE_TOLERANCE = math.radians(5)
VEL_TOLERANCE = 0.1

# Helper function to decide if action is needed

def should_fire_side_engines(angle):
    return abs(angle) > ANGLE_TOLERANCE

# Main function to decide action based on observation

def act(observation):
    x_pos, y_pos, x_vel, y_vel, angle, ang_vel, left_contact, right_contact = observation
    
    # Stabilize the angle first
    if should_fire_side_engines(angle) or abs(ang_vel) > ANGLE_TOLERANCE:
        if angle < 0:
            return 1  # Fire left engine
        else:
            return 3  # Fire right engine
    
    # Control vertical speed
    if y_vel < -SAFE_VERTICAL_SPEED:
        return 2  # Fire main engine to reduce vertical speed

    # Control horizontal speed
    if abs(x_vel) > SAFE_HORIZONTAL_SPEED:
        if x_vel > 0:
            return 1  # Fire left engine to reduce horizontal speed
        else:
            return 3  # Fire right engine to reduce horizontal speed

    # Ensure vertical alignment
    if abs(angle) > SAFE_ANGLE:
        if angle > 0:
            return 1  # Fire left engine
        else:
            return 3  # Fire right engine

    # Final positioning adjustments
    if abs(x_pos) > SAFE_HORIZONTAL_SPEED:
        if x_pos < 0:
            return 3  # Fire right engine to lurch left
        else:
            return 1  # Fire left engine to lurch right
    
    return 0  # Default action: turn off engines

Razonamiento:
Observations and Analysis:

1. Performance Comparison: The logs of my previous code reveal instability issues, particularly with horizontal and vertical velocities. Additionally, the decisions to turn off engines were not aligned with maintaining a controlled descent.

2. Angle Management: Both my code and the best-performing code prioritize stabilizing the angle. However, my code didn't adequately handle fine adjustments in angle, which led to rotational instability.

3. Vertical Speed Control: The best-performing code effectively uses the main engine to manage vertical descent speed. My code needed to incorporate vertical speed regulations more thoroughly.

4. Horizontal Speed Control: The best-performing code also manages horizontal drift by firing side engines based on horizontal velocity, which my code needs to emphasize more.

5. Consistency and Aggressiveness: The best-performing code applies more consistent and aggressive corrections to keep parameters within safe bounds, while my code may have been too conservative.

To enhance my implementation, the following steps will be prioritized:

- Incorporate consistent checks and corrections for vertical and horizontal velocities, primarily using the main and side engines as required.
- Implement more precise angle and angular velocity control, ensuring that the spacecraft remains stable without overcompensating.
- Ensure that positional adjustments use side engines for fine adjustments when approaching the landing zone.

Razonamiento:
Analyzing the successful code execution reveals certain priorities in maintaining stability during the landing process. It focused primarily on stabilizing the angle and reducing the vertical speed before fine-tuning the horizontal position and speed. This strategic approach ensured that the spacecraft did not deviate significantly from the target and stabilized the landing properly. Key points identified are early angle correction, maintaining a manageable vertical speed before reaching critical conditions, and addressing horizontal speed when necessary but secondary to the angle and vertical velocity.

In contrast, the previous efforts attempted controlled adjustments but did not consistently prioritize in an optimal sequence, leading to drifts in critical conditions.

Therefore, this revised approach simplifies the decision-making process by prioritizing angle correction first, then vertical speed, horizontal speed, followed by minor positional corrections. Following this method ensures more fine-grained results consistently aligned with target values.

### Action Plan:
1. Focus angle stabilization for primary loop.
2. Early reduction of vertical speed when exceeding safe limits.
3. Prioritize horizontal corrections after angle and vertical velocity are within safe margins.
4. Use fine-tuning of the engines to keep positional adjustments close to the desired area. 
5. Use engine bursts judiciously, leveraging minimal usage to maintain stability and reduce cumulative penalties while prioritizing stability.

Here's the revised action code focusing these priorities:

### Performance Analysis and Improvement Strategy
1. **Initial Stages**: The initial steps were decent in stabilizing the spacecraft, but over-use of side engines led to erratic changes in velocities and angles.
2. **Mid Stages**: The spacecraft showed poor management of velocities, especially horizontal ones. The penalty from firing engines frequently outweighed the benefits.
3. **Late Stages**: The spacecraft failed to manage descent velocity effectively, leading to a high-velocity crash. The use of the main engine to stabilize vertical descent was inconsistent.

### Specific Issues Identified
1. **Overcorrection with Side Engines**: Side engines were frequently used without significant angle or velocity corrections.
2. **Incomplete Vertical Speed Management**: The algorithm wasn't aggressive enough in reducing vertical descent speed early on.
3. **Horizontal Speed and Angle Mismanagement**: Continuous penalties due to poor horizontal and angle corrections.
4. **Inconsistent Stabilization Strategy**: Lack of a consistent approach to handling angular velocities and angles led to oscillations and penalties.

### Revised Strategy for Landing
1. **Primary Objective: Vertical Speed**: Maintain a consistent firing of the main engine when vertical speed exceeds safe limits.
2. **Secondary Objective: Angle Correction**: Use side engines to stabilize the angle while ensuring minimal penalties.
3. **Overall Stability**: Ensure smooth transitions with minimal abrupt engine changes that can cause oscillations.

Analyze the performance of the spacecraft and how it differs from the desired result. Be guided by the scoring system. Identify the cause of errors in your code and modify it without fear of making major changes. Think deeply about the priorities of your code and how to order and combine them correctly to achieve success. Remember that the code is a reflection of your reasoning and the way you approach the problem.

Razonamiento:
The provided logs show that the current implementation still has issues with handling angle adjustments correctly and timely. Additionally, the horizontal and vertical speeds take too long to stabilize, leading to suboptimal performance. To tackle these, we need a more refined approach where actions are taken to stabilize all parameters consistently while avoiding creating oscillations. Our new approach retains angle stabilization as the highest priority but will introduce a more careful control of speeds and positions without quickly alternating directions. Here's how we can improve further:

### Key Issues and Improvements Needed:
1. **Maintain Stability Post-Correction:** Avoid firing engines in quick succession to opposite directions, allowing for stability before further corrections.
2. **Smoother Deceleration:** Focus on gradual deceleration rather than rapid changes, primarily for vertical speed to avoid sudden jerks affecting the stability.
3. **Angle Control as Top Priority:** Ensure the angle remains nearly zero to avoid disruptions in other movements.
4. **Controlled Engine Bursts:** Provide sustained bursts rather than intermittent firings to handle speeds and angles better without increasing instability.

### Modified and Improved Code Implementation:
```python
import math

# Constants for safe landing
SAFE_HORIZONTAL_SPEED = 0.2
SAFE_VERTICAL_SPEED = 0.4
SAFE_ANGLE = 0.1
ANGLE_TOLERANCE = math.radians(5)

# Helper function to decide if action is needed

def should_fire_side_engines(angle):
    return abs(angle) > ANGLE_TOLERANCE

# Main function to decide action based on observation

def act(observation):
    x_pos, y_pos, x_vel, y_vel, angle, ang_vel, left_contact, right_contact = observation

    # Stabilize the angle first
    if should_fire_side_engines(angle) or abs(ang_vel) > ANGLE_TOLERANCE:
        if angle < 0:
            return 1  # Fire left engine
        else:

Analyze the performance of the spacecraft and how it differs from the desired result. Be guided by the scoring system. Identify the cause of errors in your code and modify it without fear of making major changes. Think deeply about the priorities of your code and how to order and combine them correctly to achieve success. Remember that the code is a reflection of your reasoning and the way you approach the problem.

Razonamiento:
Comparing the best-performing code and my last version shows areas that need improvement. The main issue remains balancing the engine firings to control velocities and maintaining stability during descent. The best-performing code achieves smoother control and a higher frequency of corrections, which seems essential. By closely analyzing the differences, I need to focus on the following points:

1. Angle and Angular Velocity Control: The best-performing code stabilizes angles early, preventing rotational instability.
2. Vertical Speed Control: It's crucial to manage vertical descent speed by using the main engine strategically, avoiding high penalties for excessive speed.
3. Horizontal Speed Control: The side engines correct horizontal drift effectively while maintaining alignment.
4. Consistency: The best-performing code executes frequent small corrections, achieving finer control over the spacecraft.
5. Code Organization: Breaking down conditions into separate blocks for clarity and combining related corrective actions.

Below is a revised reasoning and approach to code that incorporates these observations for better engine control and stability:

Analyze the performance of the spacecraft and how it differs from the desired result. Be guided by the scoring system. Identify the cause of errors in your code and modify it without fear of making major changes. Think deeply about the priorities of your code and how to order and combine them correctly to achieve success. Remember that the code is a reflection of your reasoning and the way you approach the problem.

Razonamiento:
The previous successful attempt focused on effectively balancing multiple aspects, prioritizing angle stabilization, then vertical speed control, horizontal speed control, and final safe descent positioning. Notably, while the existing approach has demonstrated some improvement, it revealed some over-complications where simultaneous corrections led to incremental penalties for not adequately stabilizing each aspect in sequence.

### Analysis and Key Improvements Needed:
1. **Angle Control**: Ensure the angle is corrected to a stabilizing orientation early and consistently.
2. **Vertical Speed**: Prevent rapid descent early to avoid large corrections later. Moderate corrections should prepare for the final slow descent.
3. **Horizontal Speed**: Manage drift early after angle and vertical speed are stabilized functions.
4. **Positional Adjustments**: Implement fine positional corrections once the spacecraft is near to vertical alignment and reduced speed.
5. **Efficient Engine Use**: Minimize unnecessary engine use penalties while providing fine and broader corrections.

Following insights, the final re-structured action code incorporates effective streamlined prioritization adjusted sequentially. Prioritization clears step-by-step crucial realignments:

Razonamiento:
### Performance Analysis and Conclusions
1. **Initial Stages**: Both the best result and my recent attempt show fairly stable initial stages. The spacecraft maintains stability in early stages but shows signs of overuse of engines without major adjustments.
2. **Mid Stages**: In both cases, there is difficulty in managing velocities leading to erratic movements. Engine firings were not well-organized, leading to penalties for frequently firing engines without significant corrections.
3. **Late Stages**: Both codes struggled with managing descent velocity effectively. Main engine usage remained inconsistent, leading to a crash.
4. **Score Analysis**: The new attempt had a total score of -131.89 due to excessive penalties from engine usage and failed to stabilize the descent. The best attempt had a more structured approach despite high penalties in certain steps.

### Identified Problems
1. **Over-Correction with Side Engines**: Continuous unbalanced use of side engines without achieving necessary corrections in angle and velocity.
2. **Inconsistent Vertical Speed Management**: Lack of targeted usage of the main engine to slow down vertical speed.
3. **Erratic Horizontal Speed and Angle Management**: Horizontal speed and angles oscillated causing more penalties.
4. **Priority Constraints**: The nuances of handling multiple parameters together were not well-refined.

### Steps to Improve Function
1. **Profound Vertical Speed Control**: Utilize main engine with precise logic to manage vertical speed effectively.
2. **Balanced Angle and Velocity Control**: Ensure side engines are used strategically for angle corrections keeping velocity in check.
3. **Organized Horizontal Speed**: Proper balance between engine firings to manage X and Y velocities.
4. **Priority-based Decision Making**: Factor precise conditions controlling the importance of corrections dynamically.

Razonamiento:
Upon further review, it remains evident that the spacecraft struggles with stability, especially oscillating between actions. This happens due to the binary action style where the engines are quickly alternated. Additionally, the angle control and speed regulation need further refinement to maintain steady descent and alignment. Here are the steps to address these issues systematically:

### Key issues and steps for improvement:
1. **Persistent Angle Stabilization:** Ensure the angle is consistently checked and corrected before other parameters, avoiding oscillations.
2. **Vertical Speed Management:** Control vertical descending speed to stabilize at a slow and steady rate without sudden bursts creating instability.
3. **Horizontal Speed Regulation:** Maintain minimal horizontal drift by corrective measures when drift exceeds safe bounds.
4. **Controlled Engine Usage:** Instead of immediate opposite corrections, allow one set of engines to complete corrections before toggling others.
5. **Position Management:** Only apply lateral adjustments when necessary, ensuring the spacecraft is close to the target area softly without increasing velocity.

### Revised Python Code Implementation:
```python
import math

# Constants for safe landing
SAFE_HORIZONTAL_SPEED = 0.2
SAFE_VERTICAL_SPEED = 0.4
SAFE_ANGLE = 0.1
ANGLE_TOLERANCE = math.radians(5)  # Converted to radians for angle tolerance

# Helper function to decide if action is needed

def should_fire_side_engines(angle):
    return abs(angle) > ANGLE_TOLERANCE

# Main function to decide action based on observation

def act(observation):
    x_pos, y_pos, x_vel, y_vel, angle, ang_vel, left_contact, right_contact = observation

    # Stabilize the angle first
    if should_fire_side_engines(angle) or abs(ang_vel) > ANGLE_TOLERANCE:
        if angle < 0:
            return 1  # Fire left engine
        else:
            return 3  # Fire right engine

    # Control vertical speed
    if y_vel < -SAFE_VERTICAL_SPEED:
        return 2  # Fire main engine to reduce vertical speed

    # Control horizontal speed
    if abs(x_vel) > SAFE_HORIZONTAL_SPEED:
        if x_vel > 0:
            return 1  # Fire left engine to reduce horizontal speed
        else:
            return 3  # Fire right engine to reduce horizontal speed

    # Ensure vertical alignment if no major horizontal drift
    if abs(angle) > SAFE_ANGLE:
        if angle > 0:
            return 1  # Fire left engine
        else:
            return 3  # Fire right engine

    # Positional Adjustments if all else is stable
    if abs(x_pos) > SAFE_HORIZONTAL_SPEED:
        if x_pos < 0:
            return 3  # Fire right engine to lurch left
        else:
            return 1  # Fire left engine to lurch right

    # If all conditions are within the safe range, turn off engines
    return 0
```
This script reorders the conditional checks to ensure corrections are carried out in a structured sequence. By prioritizing the stabilization of critical parameters, it reduces the oscillations and promotes a steady descent trajectory. This should enhance the overall stability and enable successful landings more reliably.

Razonamiento:
Analyzing the logs of my previous code and comparing it with the best-performing code shows the following key differences:

1. **Consistency in Angle Control**: The best-performing code consistently stabilizes the angle early and effectively. My code's angle corrections were not as effective, resulting in persistent angular instability.

2. **Vertical Speed Management**: The best-performing code manages vertical speed effectively, consistently using the main engine to control descent speed. My previous code didn't activate the main engine as effectively, resulting in higher descent speeds.

3. **Horizontal Speed Management**: The best-performing code manages horizontal drift effectively by frequently correcting horizontal velocities. My previous code could also adjust this more proactively.

4. **Edge Cases Handling**: The best-performing code smoothly transitions between actions, maintaining controls during different phases of landing. My code needs better transition handling for smoother operations during descent.

The steps to improve the code involve the following:

- **Frequent and Early Angle Corrections:** Prioritize angle corrections to stabilize early in the descent phase.
- **Consistent Vertical Speed Management:** Use the main engine more effectively to control vertical descent speed, ensuring smooth and controlled landings.
- **Horizontal Speed Adjustments:** Proactively correct horizontal drift using side engines to maintain a centered position relative to the landing zone.
- **Refactoring Conditions:** Ensure conditions for action transitions are smooth and effectively balance priorities during descent.

Here is the refined code:

Razonamiento:
Comparing to the previous result, there are essential insights to make corrections and prioritize actions more effectively. The past script effectively managed to balance using corrections for angle, descent speed, and drift in a systematic manner, which presented more precise adjustments, unlike previous attempts juggling simultaneous aspects yielding increased cumulative penalties.

Key modifications and strategy considerations for improvement/optimization:
1. **Angle Preemption:** Effective stabilization early confines sway affecting later needed corrections extensively benefiting consistent descent stage stability, avoiding overuse penalizing thrusters impacting descending smoothly.
2. **Vertical Dampening:** Sensure dampening descent vertical speed conditioning avoiding heavy penalizations, stressing controlled descent velocity maintenance.
3. **Contained Drift:** Subsequently after ensuring conditions maintained around manageable angles/vertical speed, corrections shifting focus to large positional deviations kept under tolerance edges.
4. **Iterated Fine-tuning:** Gradual incremental corrections observing nearing ground should ensure aligned upright, consistently rational suitable minor thrusters enabling smooth nearing land state.

Formulated improvements bring systematically staged calm descent realistic evaluation conditions meeting landing parameters efficiently minimizing extensive penalties thus ensuring improved landings systematically.

Enhanced action code script follows:

### Performance Analysis and Improvements
1. **Initial Stages**: Compared to my attempts, the best result code has more consistent engine management, focusing on initial stabilization and early descent control with fewer penalties.
2. **Mid Stages**: The transition between stabilizing, controlling descent, and managing velocities are better structured in the best code, despite some oscillations in the parameters.
3. **Late Stages**: Vertical speed control improves as the descent progresses. The penalties from engine adjustments are minimized through more thoughtful intermittent use of engines.
4. **Score Impact**: My attempts produced more severe penalties due to overuse of engines without effective corrections. The best code manages to strike a balance between corrections and penalties, with careful consideration of priorities.

### Identified Issues in My Attempt
1. **Excessive Side Engine Usage**: Overcorrection using side engines without achieving significant stabilization.
2. **Poor Vertical Speed Management**: Inconsistent use of the main engine to reduce vertical speed leads to a crash.
3. **Inconsistent Angle Control**: Management of angles and angular velocities shows erratic adjustments contributing to penalties.
4. **Priority Handling**: Misaligned priorities leading to improper action selections between angle, speed, and position corrections.

### Revised Strategy for Landing
1. **Primary Objective: Vertical Speed Management**: Consistent and adept use of the main engine when managing descent speeds.
2. **Secondary Objective: Angle Control**: Strategic use of side engines for angle control while balancing penalties.
3. **Tertiary Objective: Horizontal and Position Adjustments**: Maintain horizontal alignments ensuring minimal engine use.
4. **Optimized Decision Flow**: Logical flow with clear priorities to handle multiple corrections smarter and effectively.

Razonamiento:
To achieve a successful landing, it is essential to carefully manage the spacecraft's position, velocity, and orientation so that it can land within the target area with minimal tilt and speed. Here is a detailed breakdown of the observations and their meanings:

1. X position: Horizontal position relative to the landing zone. Keeping this value within a certain range is crucial to ensure the spacecraft lands within the target area.
2. Y position: Vertical position relative to the landing zone. A lower value is preferred when approaching landing.
3. X velocity: Horizontal speed. Ideally, this should be minimized to ensure the spacecraft is not drifting sideways too much.
4. Y velocity: Vertical speed. A lower value indicates a soft landing - this should be reduced when the spacecraft gets closer to the ground.
5. Angle: Orientation relative to vertical. The spacecraft should be as upright as possible (angle close to 0) to avoid a hard or tilted landing.
6. Angular velocity: Rate of change in angle. This should be minimized to achieve a stable landing.
7. Left contact sensor: Indicates if the left side of the spacecraft is in contact with the landing zone.
8. Right contact sensor: Indicates if the right side of the spacecraft is in contact with the landing zone.

The actions available are:

0: Switch off engines - Saves fuel but does not correct any trajectory or velocity.
1: Push left engine - Helps to move right and correct anti-clockwise spin.
2: Push both engines (upwards) - Reduces the overall vertical and horizontal velocity, slows descent, stabilizes the craft.
3: Push right engine - Helps to move left and correct clockwise spin.

To achieve a successful landing, the steps are:
1. Maintain the X position close to the center of the landing zone by firing the left/right engines as needed.
2. Gradually reduce the Y velocity by firing the center engine intermittently to slow down descent without increasing the tilt.
3. Adjust the angle to keep it as close to 0 as possible using the side engines to counter any rotation.
4. Avoid overusing the engines, especially the center engine, as it reduces the score.
5. Aim for a final touchdown with minimal horizontal and vertical velocity (<0.1 if possible) and an upright angle (close to 0).

Based on the log analysis, we can formulate a strategy that dynamically decides on the action based on the current state observations. Here is the implementation of the new `act` function using this reasoning:

Razonamiento:
By analyzing the logs provided for both successful and unsuccessful landing attempts, we can understand how different actions influence the spacecraft's status and score. Each action corresponds to firing different engines which modify the spacecraft's current state: X position, Y position, X velocity, Y velocity, Angle, Angular velocity, and contact sensors.

**Successful Landing Analysis**:
1. Maintaining low horizontal velocity is crucial to avoid drifting from the landing zone.
2. Minimizing vertical velocity and descending gently ensures a soft landing, avoiding high impact.
3. Keeping the angle close to zero is essential to land upright and prevent tilting.
4. Using the side engines sparingly to adjust the horizontal position without excessive lean.
5. Prioritizing stability (avoiding frequent switches between actions) to maintain control over the spacecraft.
6. The center engine should be used to control rapid descent but should not be overused due to high penalty points.
7. To stabilize, it's often better to use the side engines intermittently rather than constant center engine thrust.
8. Avoid sudden and drastic changes in angle and velocity close to the ground.

**Unsuccessful Landing Analysis**:
1. High horizontal velocities lead to drifting off the landing zone.
2. High vertical velocities result in crash-landing due to high impact force.
3. Excessive angles lead to tilted landings and possible crashes.
4. Overuse of side and center engines results in high penalty points and destabilizes the spacecraft.
5. Consistent use of engines without monitoring velocity increases chances of crashing.

**Steps to Improve Landing**:
1. Start with a small throttle on side engines if horizontal velocity is high.
2. Gradually reduce vertical speed using the center engine but avoid consistent use.
3. Adjust the angle using the side engines to maintain an upright position.
4. Aim for a soft landing by lowering vertical velocity before touch-down.
5. Minimize angle deviation by gentle and controlled use of side engines.

Below is the updated `act` function to implement these insights based on the reasoning.

Analyze the performance of the spacecraft and how it differs from the desired result. Be guided by the scoring system. Identify the cause of errors in your code and modify it without fear of making major changes. Think deeply about the priorities of your code and how to order and combine them correctly to achieve success. Remember that the code is a reflection of your reasoning and the way you approach the problem.

Razonamiento:
To maximize the landing score, the strategy should prioritize maintaining control over the spacecraft's speed, position, and orientation. Based on the given successful landing log and the failed landing example, it's crucial to control the following parameters while minimizing the usage of the engines due to their penalty on the score.

1. Position Control:
   - X Position and Velocity: Keep the horizontal position (X) close to 0, avoiding large deviations, and minimize horizontal velocity over time to avoid lateral movement upon landing.
   - Y Position and Velocity: Gradually decrease vertical position (Y) to 0, ensuring vertical velocity is controlled and decreased over time to avoid crashes upon impact.

2. Angular Control:
   - Angle and Angular Velocity: Keep the angle near 0 to ensure the spacecraft is upright, and minimize change in angle to avoid tilting which can cause crashes.

3. Engine Usage:
   - Avoid excessive usage of the left or right engines as it incurs 0.03 penalty per frame and avoid the center engine due to a higher 0.3 penalty. Balance the need for stabilization versus engine penalties.
   - Use the engines judiciously to correct the spacecraft's path without introducing uncontrolled motion.

**Action Effects**:
- `0` (Switch off engines): No change in thrust, allows the spacecraft to continue in its current path with gravity acting on it.
- `1` (Push left engine): Provides thrust to rotate and move to the right. Useful for correcting left tilts or moving the spacecraft right.
- `2` (Push both engines): Provides upward thrust decreasing vertical speed and stabilizes horizontal speed.
- `3` (Push right engine): Provides thrust to rotate and move to the left. Useful to correct right tilts or move the spacecraft left.

**Steps for a Successful Landing**:
1. Continuously monitor the X and Y velocities, ensuring they are within safe thresholds for descent.
2. Use action `2` (both engines) to slow down descent when vertical speed becomes too high.
3. Use actions `1` or `3` (left or right engines) to correct any tilt or horizontal deviations, keeping the angle stable to avoid side impacts.
4. Minimize the use of `0` (switch off engines) during high-speed descent phases‚Äîuse it when the spacecraft's speed is within control or already near the landing zone.
5. Regularly assess the spacecraft's angle and make necessary corrections to ensure it's not tilted excessively during the final descent.
6. Approach the landing zone gradually reducing both positional velocities and ensure the spacecraft maintains an upright position with minimal angular velocity.

With these points in mind, replace the random action selection with a more context-aware approach.

Razonamiento:
From the logs of the different landing attempts, each value and each change in the observations has specific implications for how the spacecraft behaves. The observations include the spacecraft's position, velocity (both horizontal and vertical), angle, angular velocity, and whether the left and right contact sensors are engaged with the landing zone.

Analyzing these logs, we see that certain actions directly correlate to changes in these observations. Specifically:
- '0': Switching off engines leads to the spacecraft continuing its motion without additional thrust, which can lead to faster descent and higher velocities depending on the previous state.
- '1': Pushing the left engine will counteract rightward movement and reduce positive angular velocity (rotate spacecraft counter-clockwise), while increasing leftward movement if currently heading right.
- '2': Engaging both engines generally reduces the vertical velocity, thus slowing down descent.
- '3': Pushing the right engine counteracts leftward movement and reduces negative angular velocity (rotate the spacecraft clockwise), while increasing rightward movement if currently heading left.

To achieve a successful landing, we need to maximize the score by minimizing tilts, sticking close to the landing area (both horizontally and vertically), reducing velocities, and ensuring a smooth touch down. This means careful and well-timed adjustments using the engines. Here's a proposed method for the `act` function:

1. If the spacecraft's vertical velocity is too high (descent is too quick), engage both engines (Action 2).
2. If the spacecraft is tilted, use the left or right engines to counteract angular velocity and stabilize it, dependent on the angular velocity sign.
3. If the spacecraft drifts horizontally (non-zero horizontal velocity), apply the opposite side engines to nullify this drift.
4. Implement a decision structure to toggle between engine actions based on thresholds defined for the velocities and positions relative to the landing zone.

With these steps in mind, the `act` function will try to keep the spacecraft aligned, reduce its drift, and stabilize descent for a successful landing.

Razonamiento:
Analyzing the most successful code and comparing it with mine, several critical insights can be drawn:

1. Prioritization: The successful code prioritizes reducing horizontal velocity and maintaining an upright position before controlling descent speed. My code initially focused heavily on reducing vertical velocity, which left horizontal corrections and angular stability too late, causing instability.

2. Action Overuse: Overusing the same action consecutively led to significant angular velocity and positional drifts. A more dynamic approach that varies the action appropriately based on the current status yields better control.

3. Simplicity: The successful code maintains simplicity and logical grouping of decisions, ensuring it adjusts based on the most critical parameters first.

4. Fine-tuning Close to Ground: Fine adjustments are crucial as the spacecraft approaches the ground. Horizontal and angular corrections at lower altitudes need careful handling.

5. Angular Correction: The significance of angular correction early ensures the spacecraft descends in an upright position, minimizing abrupt corrections close to ground.

Based on these insights, the revised code needs to balance horizontal, vertical, and angular adjustments dynamically. It should prioritize horizontal control first if it exceeds threshold values, followed by descent speed control and then angular adjustments. Here‚Äôs the enhanced approach:

Razonamiento:
The recent log indicates that while the initial actions kept the spacecraft's horizontal and vertical velocities under control, prolonged and repetitive use led to issues. The primary problem stems from using the left engine extensively, causing significant tilt and eventually leading to a crash landing. Additionaly, the velocity increased instead of stabilizing over time. However, we learned from the logs that some of the scoring was improved by stabilizing horizontal and vertical velocities for short periods.

1. Excessive cumulative use of the left engine induced significant tilt (angle) and high angular velocity, leading to loss of control and stabilization issues
2. Not switching strategies when angle drifted significantly, which led to worsened drift and instability in observations
3. Excessive engine firing, particularly side engines, without clear strategy for maintaining upright position and reducing vertical speed
4. No clear stabilization phase, results in persistent increase in negative outcomes over time

**Updated Strategy**:
1. Alternate between actions more intelligently to stabilize horizontal and vertical position.
2. Use both engines (action 2) primarily to stabilize descent and only use side engines (actions 1 and 3) sparingly to adjust horizontal drift and angular tilt.
3. Introduce quick recovery phases where no engines fire to counteract excessive tilting and angular velocity, regain control over tilt.
4. Minimize angle and angular velocity by evaluating angles close to zero for short periods.

**Updated Code:**
Below, we will modify the code to address the above observations and integrate better strategies for landing the spacecraft successfully.

Razonamiento:
The given best result code takes a more systematic approach to control the spacecraft's descent and horizontal movement. It focuses on:
1. Reducing horizontal speed when it's too high (abs(x_velocity) > 0.2).
2. Controlling descent speed when it's too fast (y_velocity < -0.5).
3. Maintaining the spacecraft's upright orientation by correcting tilt when the angle is off (abs(angle) > 0.1).
4. Fine-tuning the horizontal position and descent speed when close to the ground (y_position < 0.3).
5. Using a default action (0: switch off engines) if no immediate adjustments are needed.

The results of the failed attempt indicate that the lack of actions for a significant part of the descent led to an uncontrollable increase in speed and deviation from the desired position.

To improve the performance, the following steps should be considered:
- Actively manage the position, speed, and orientation using the available actions at each step.
- Implement boundaries for velocities to ensure controlled movements.
- Ensure the spacecraft is centered horizontally and upright as much as possible while descending.
- Avoid excessive or repetitive use of a single engine action to prevent destabilization.

Considering these points, the modified code should integrate the best practices observed in the best result while correcting any identified weaknesses.

Razonamiento:
Analyzing the successful landing attempt with the code that scored -67.181, significant insights can be drawn. Primarily, the main observations suggest that better handling of x_velocity, y_velocity, and angle yields better outcomes. The best performing strategy addresses specific situations like reducing velocities cautiously and managing angles effectively. Additionally, prioritizing the landing zone closeness by adjusting horizontal positions and finely descending helps maintain control to avoid crashes.

1. **Horizontal Movement**: Reducible by adjusting x_velocity when it crosses certain thresholds using side engines (actions 1 and 3 respectively). This approach helps stabilize lateral drift quickly compared to a less aggressive strategy.

2. **Vertical Movement**: Using the center engine (action 2) to control the descent during fast falls helps mitigate hard impacts. Ensuring a threshold where the descent speed is within controllable limits drastically reduces crashes and helps coordinate smaller tilt adjustments.

3. **Upright Maintenance**: Ensuring an upright landing by minimizing angles using side engines to correct large deviations. Control of this tilt ensures the craft remains in an optimal vertical orientation avoiding toppling over.

4. **Proximity Handling**: When closer to the ground, fine-tuning descent and horizontal movement become paramount to achieving a more controlled landing focusing on both lateral and vertical elements.

Here's a refined version of the `act` function based on the analysis:

Razonamiento:
The logs show that while some descent speed was reduced and upright orientation was moderately maintained, consistent issues with overreliance on a single action and poor handling of the critical near-ground phase caused high overall velocities or significant angular changes. We need a multifaceted approach, considering which part of the descent phase we are in and the relative importance of each parameter.

The optimal solution should:
1. **Early Phase:** Focus on moderating lateral movement and gradually reducing vertical descent if initial conditions are safe.
2. **Mid Descent:** Balance lateral velocity adjustments with modest descent speed control and keep angular deviation minimal.
3. **Pre-landing:** Critically manage very tight vertical descent control, minimal lateral drift, and near-zero angular deviation.

Key points to address:
- Ensure switching decisions dynamically considering precisions across phases (e.g., faster reactions closer to ground).
- Combine adjustments (min velocity and angle corrections simultaneously when relevant).
- Integrate thresholds better for conditional logic branching to synchronize primary control needs per descent phases.

Razonamiento:
Upon analyzing both the previous and last logs, here are key insights and action points for improvement: 
1. **Horizontal Velocity**: Both logs consistently reduced the horizontal velocity effectively in the first few steps by using side engines. However, the drop in velocity wasn't maintained properly at all times and the descent control was lost.
2. **Vertical Velocity**: The vertical descent was controlled initially in both cases but degraded over time, leading to crash-landings eventually. This highlighted the need to moderate the descent speed better.
3. **Angle and Angular Velocity**: Both logs faced significant challenges in maintaining a low angle and angular velocity. Prolonged use of side engines caused severe tilts and loss of stability. The over-reliance on side engines caused a significant increase in angular displacement.
4. **Engine Usage**: Excessive engine usage, particularly side engines, caused increased tilt and loss of control over stability. Fine-tuning the engine usage and reducing its overuse especially when tilts are witnessed, is essential.
5. **Late Stage Issues**: Stability challenges increased as the spacecraft descended closer to the ground due to increased speeds and angles. The scores indicated the worsening situation.

**New Plan**: 
Reflecting on the above points, the main actions to fine-tune in the updated code would be as follows:
1. Minimize any significant horizontal movements early before the vertical descent becomes critical.
2. Introduce periodic engine cooling phases by switching off or maintaining lower engine usage to re-stabilize from excessive angular velocity.
3. Implement more frequent but modified controlled use of both engines to fine-tune movements gently, as opposed to heavy and high-speed course corrections.
4. Improve angle control by alternating use of side engines more intelligently.
5. Introduce fall-back mechanisms to switch-off engines more often to stabilize when angular velocity and angle increase.
6. Enhance controlled descent as it approaches the landing zone.

Applying these changes, the updated code is provided below:

Razonamiento:
To improve the landing results, strategies for a better landing have to consider several aspects. The best result already demonstrates a decent balance of actions to control the spacecraft. However, it could be optimized by ensuring more precise control over vertical and horizontal speeds and positions, as well as by minimizing the usage of engines to avoid negative score impacts.

Here are the issues observed from the previous runs:
1. Excessive use of actions 1 and 3 (left and right engines) at the beginning, causing unnecessary horizontal movements and tilting.
2. Insufficient correction of vertical descent speed in early stages leading to uncontrollable height loss later.
3. Only moderate usage of action 2 (center engine) to control descent rate.

Several steps are laid out below to optimize the descend approach:
1. Use horizontal engine controls (actions 1 & 3) only when x_velocity exceeds a smaller threshold.
2. Regularly assess vertical speed and utilize the center engine to reduce descent speed fairly early, to maintain better control throughout descent.
3. Introduce checks to balance horizontal position control and ensure both position and speed are safe before descending further towards landing.

The modified code based on this refined approach is provided below.

Razonamiento:
By observing the previously successful and our unsuccessful attempts, it becomes clear three key aspects need addressing: precise control of horizontal velocity, adjusting vertical descent rate, and minimizing spacecraft angle more effectively.

1. **Horizontal Velocity Control**: This should be prioritized when it exceeds a certain threshold. Previous logs demonstrated effective control for x_velocity >0.2. Hence, the algorithm should immediately counteract excessive horizontal movement using side engines.
2. **Vertical Descent Control**: Maintaining a controlled descent by engaging the center engine and monitoring the rate of fall improves stability. This approach will reduce hard landing impacts and scattered engine firing patterns previously observed.
3. **Upright Orientation**: Maintaining the spacecraft angle within acceptable limits (abs(angle) < 0.1) promotes safe landings, avoiding potential tilting or toppling impacts. Adjusting angle rules should be redefined to prioritize stability.
4. **Proximity Adjustments**: Close to the landing zone ensures refined control over both horizontal positioning and descent. Implement finer adjustments when the spacecraft is < 0.3 units from the ground.
5. **Fine-tuning**: Fine-tuning actions when the spacecraft is nearing the surface include reducing velocities and aligning position to center landing area with firmer rules.

Effectuating the above strategies, the adjusted `act` function is defined:

Analyze the performance of the spacecraft and how it differs from the desired result. Be guided by the scoring system. Identify the cause of errors in your code and modify it without fear of making major changes. Think deeply about the priorities of your code and how to order and combine them correctly to achieve success. Remember that the code is a reflection of your reasoning and the way you approach the problem.

Razonamiento:
Analyzing the latest logs, it can be observed that the spacecraft was able to control its descent somewhat better, but still failed to achieve a successful landing. Here are some key insights:
1. **Horizontal Velocity:** The spacecraft managed to reduce horizontal velocity initially but then started oscillating, especially after moderate altitude.
2. **Vertical Velocity:** There was still insufficient control leading to high downward speed. Relying too much on the same action consecutively introduced instability.
3. **Angular Adjustments:** There seemed inadequate angular control, especially in tighter phases near ground.
4. **Action Consistency:** Overusing single actions like '3' consecutively without feedback loops for current state adjustments failed to correct velocities effectively.

Next Steps to Improve:
- **Introduce Conditional Action Switching:** Based on dynamic observation within closer altitude thresholds, ensure tight feedback loops guiding angular and velocity corrective actions.
- **Balance Corrections:** Fine-tune combined action responses across height stages dynamically reflecting immediate conditions adequately.

The improved code will involve:
- Dynamic threshold checks and corrections interlaced with velocity and angular state feedback.
- Refactored balance across descent phases to ensure priority handling closer to ground.

Here is the revised code:

Razonamiento:
Upon analyzing the logs and comparing the previous codes, a few key issues and improvements can be identified. The provided successful code focuses on stabilizing horizontal and vertical velocities in early, mid, and final phases with specific thresholds. This layered approach ensures that corrective actions are more precise as the spacecraft descends.

Key Insights for Improvement:
1. **Phased Approach**: Utilizing early, mid, and final phase strategies helps in breaking down the descent into manageable segments, allowing precise adjustments in each phase.
2. **Stabilization Thresholds**: Clearly defined thresholds for horizontal velocity, vertical velocity, and angle in each phase ensure that the spacecraft remains within safe parameters.
3. **Gentle Adjustments**: The successful code relies on making finer adjustments closer to the landing zone, which helps in maintaining control and stability.
4. **Reduced Engine Usage**: Excessive use of side engines was avoided which prevented drastic angular changes.

Updated Plan:
1. Implement the phased approach to handle early, mid, and final phases with distinct corrective actions.
2. Define thresholds for horizontal velocity, vertical velocity, and angle in each phase.
3. Make finer adjustments in the final phase for smooth and controlled landing.
4. Ensure the use of center engine to minimize vertical descent speed and side engines only for necessary corrections.
5. Introduce occasional checks to switch off engines to stabilize when necessary.

The following is an updated code reflecting these considerations:

Razonamiento:
To improve the performance of the spacecraft further, it's critical to refine the handling strategies for each key phase of the descent. The best result so far utilized a phased approach where the spacecraft's control priorities changed as it descended. This best result could still be improved by making sure the spacecraft adjusts its speed and positioning more precisely during the final stages of descent. Additionally, more sensitive angular corrections in the early phase can ensure a smoother and safer descent throughout. Here is a detailed plan to guide the refinements:

1. **Early Phase Enhancements** (y_position > 1.0):
    - Prioritize horizontal stabilization for any significant drift.
    - Continuously moderate vertical speed for smoother transitions to mid and lower phases.
    - Make angular corrections earlier to maintain stability and prevent tilted descents.

2. **Mid Phase Adjustments** (0.3 < y_position ‚â§ 1.0):
    - Balance horizontal velocity reductions with slight reductions in vertical speed.
    - Apply slightly more sensitive angular corrections to ensure stability.

3. **Final Pre-Landing Adjustments** (y_position ‚â§ 0.3):
    - Fine-tune horizontal positioning to near zero as accurately as possible.
    - Gentle control on vertical speed to avoid abrupt descents.

By carefully integrating these adjustments in a phased control approach, here's a refined code:

Razonamiento:
By evaluating the previous log, we can make observations to improve upon the code designed to align the spacecraft's descent. The logs of the previous best attempt optimized for transitions between altitude phases, managing horizontal and vertical velocities accordingly.

1. **Phase-Based Decision Making**: Dividing the descent into phases based on altitude proved beneficial. During the high-altitude phase (>1.0), focusing on controlling horizontal velocity and stabilizing descent provided a foundation. As altitude decreases (<1.0), the focus shifts to finer adjustments.

2. **Specific Phase Priorities**: Each phase-controlled parameters differently; high-altitude prioritized horizontal movement and tilts, mid-phase balanced both. Final descent fine-tuned minor alterations maintaining stability towards the landing zone.

3. **Fine-tuning near Landing**: Integrating minimal tolerances in angle, velocity, maintaining controlled descent for safe landing was highly effective.

4. **Clear Priorities**: Establish clearer prioritization across phases - targeting horizontal drifts and excessive vertical velocities first, then stabilizing orientation followed by minor fine-tuning.

Key improvements for enhancing previous code involve adopting these prioritized transitions, initiating control on both velocity components early, and ensuring stabilization over excessive corrective actions.

The improved `act` function is defined below:

Razonamiento:
When comparing my latest code with the previous one that achieved the best result, it‚Äôs clear that there are a few key differences and mistakes. Here are the primary issues and insights from the comparison:

1. **Excessive Use of Single Actions**: My latest approach relied too heavily on firing the same action repeatedly, particularly '3'. This led to oscillations and instability in both horizontal and angular velocities.

2. **Delayed Response to Angles**: The angular corrections were not managed effectively, leading to significant angular drifts and eventual tilts.

3. **Improper Vertical Descent Handling**: The vertical descent control was not handled optimally, leading to excessive speed nearing the ground.

To improve, the code must dynamically balance the actions more effectively, reducing overreliance on a single action and using shorter feedback loops for adjustments. Specifically, it needs to:
- Introduce more balanced corrections dynamically.
- Improve the angular and horizontal velocity corrections, especially in the last phases.
- Refine switching thresholds closely based on the current conditions, ensuring correction priorities balance adequately.

Here is the improved code:

Razonamiento:
Examining the logs and the previous phases, it is clear that while the phase-based approach has improved the descent, over-reliance on side engines during one particular phase has negated the stability achieved initially. Over multiple frames, the horizontal corrections were achieved at the expense of substantial tilt and angular velocity management, which later created issues in steady descent and reduced overall control. 

**Key Observations and Causes of Failures:** 
1. **Overuse of Side Engines**: Continuous triggering of side engines (actions 1 and 3) led to significant tilt and high angular velocity, leading to instability, rapid angular changes, and loss of control towards the end.
2. **Neglecting Center Engine Usage**: Insufficient usage of the center engine (Action 2) to stabilize descent  resulted in eventual high vertical speed, which further exacerbated stability challenges close to the ground.
3. **Transitions Between Phases**: The transitions between the different phases need better smoothening and adjustments at boundaries to minimalize abrupt control changes.
4. **Angular Corrections**: Angular corrections still lead to notable oscillations, impacting scores and final landing efficiency.

**Updated Strategy:** 
1. **Balanced Engine Usage**: Ensure more balanced engine usage, by integrating intermittent center engine firing to moderate descent while side engines are used more judiciously, minimizing abrupt tilts.
2. **Updated Phase Criteria**: Fine-tune the threshold criteria for the three phased approaches to ensure a smoother transition and incorporate stability checks to switch off engines periodically to stabilize.
3. **Controlled Descent Prioritization**: Focus on consistent controlled descent to keep vertical speed manageable while adjusting horizontal drift minimally without introducing excessive angular variations.
4. **Angular Stabilization**: Implement additional checks to minimize firing when angular stabilization requires priority, leaning slightly to slower vertical descents if necessary.

Analyze the performance of the spacecraft and how it differs from the desired result. Be guided by the scoring system. Identify the cause of errors in your code and modify it without fear of making major changes. Think deeply about the priorities of your code and how to order and combine them correctly to achieve success. Remember that the code is a reflection of your reasoning and the way you approach the problem.

Razonamiento:
The recent results indicate that while the overall control strategy for descent was sound, the implementation and timely execution of corrections for position, speed, and angle can be improved further. The following conclusions have been drawn after comparing the best result with previous unsuccessful attempts:
1. **Horizontal Drift Control**: Properly handled through gradual corrections early in descent, but sometimes left uncorrected leading to higher sidewards movement later.
2. **Vertical Speed Moderation**: Consistent application needed to smooth out the descent and avoid 'bouncing' actions from sudden speed adjustments.
3. **Angle Control**: More sensitive adjustment thresholds can stabilize the craft quicker, reducing tilt oscillations.
4. **Precise Positioning**: Fine-tuning becomes vital close to landing. This phase specifically needs delicate handling to manage both minimal drift and descent rate simultaneously.

Given these observations, the phased control approach can be made more responsive and intelligent by introducing condition-based fine-tuning and a feedback loop that continuously checks each parameter's rate of change to preemptively adjust before larger deviations occur. This should mitigate overshooting or prolonged instability in position, speed, or tilt.

Razonamiento:
The provided code, which achieved the best result of -60.659, demonstrated significant success by adapting the phase-based approach to control horizontal velocity and vertical descent rates. Here's a refined analysis that forms the basis for the improved function:

1. **Early Phase (>1.0 height)**: Prioritize horizontal stabilization. Correct horizontal drift if velocity exceeds 0.2 using side engines. Control descent with the center engine if falling too quickly. Stabilize angular deviance to minimize tilts. Balanced descent otherwise.

2. **Mid Phase (0.3 < height ‚â§ 1.0)**: Balance horizontal and vertical adjustments, with increased sensitivity. Horizontal drift adjustments are subtler, targeting velocities >0.1. Reduced threshold of downward velocity control. Address angular adjustments with minor deviations. Balanced descent otherwise.

3. **Final Pre-landing Phase (height ‚â§ 0.3)**: Precise tuning for landing. Minimize horizontal drift, ensure soft landing vertical velocities. Minor angular adjustments to ensure proper alignment. Ensure final controlled descent.

The resulting adjustments prioritize stabilization and minimal tolerance angles, horizontal velocities, and vertical descent, refining the code to ensure successful landing attempt outcomes. Below is the improved design for `act` function:

Analyze the performance of the spacecraft and how it differs from the desired result. Be guided by the scoring system. Identify the cause of errors in your code and modify it without fear of making major changes. Think deeply about the priorities of your code and how to order and combine them correctly to achieve success. Remember that the code is a reflection of your reasoning and the way you approach the problem.

Razonamiento:
To achieve a successful landing, it is critical to control three main aspects of the spacecraft: its position (X and Y coordinates), its velocity (both X and Y components), and its angle (with its angular velocity). Successful landings occur when: 
1. The X and Y positions are within optimal ranges relative to the landing zone, ensuring the spacecraft isn't too far away. 
2. The X and Y velocities are minimized to prevent hard landing. 
3. The angle is near zero to avoid tipping over. 

Analyzing the provided logs shows that random actions lead to: 
- Significant horizontal and vertical velocity, often too high for a safe landing.
- Angular displacements and angular velocity leading to instability. 
- Inefficient engine usage, consuming points unnecessarily.

Steps to achieve a controlled and successful landing:
1. Prioritize reducing horizontal and vertical velocities. This likely involves frequent use of the central engine (action 2) to decrease Y velocity and using the side engines (actions 1 and 3) to mitigate horizontal drift and adjust the angle.
2. Gradually reduce X velocity to nearly zero while ensuring the Y velocity is low just before the landing zone proximity.
3. Actively control the angle and angular velocity by firing side engines as necessary to maintain near-zero angles.
4. Optimize engine usage to maintain a positive score by minimizing unnecessary firings.
5. Utilize heuristics to achieve the above goals rather than relying on random actions.

Implementing these guidelines into the `act` function, yielding a more deterministic control strategy for the spacecraft:

Razonamiento:
To maximize the landing score, it's important to understand how actions affect the spacecraft's behavior and resulting observations. Here's a detailed analysis: 

1. **X and Y Position Changes**: X position should be minimized to align the spacecraft horizontally over the landing zone. Y position represents the height, and ideally, it should decrease gently until landing.

2. **X and Y Velocity**: Horizontal velocity (X velocity) should be nearly zero at landing to avoid sideways movement. Vertical velocity (Y velocity) should also be minimized for a soft landing. High descending speeds (large negative Y velocities) or any significant lateral movements are undesirable near landing.

3. **Angle and Angular Velocity**: The spacecraft should be vertically aligned (angle close to 0), and the angular velocity must be minimized to avoid tilting during touchdown.

4. **Engine Actions**:
    - Action 0: No engines firing. The spacecraft continues its current trajectory with no correction.
    - Action 1: Left engine firing. Helps to correct by pushing the craft to the right and possibly tilting it left to counteract right-side tilts.
    - Action 2: Central engine firing. Provides a strong upward thrust to counteract descent speed and correct angles.
    - Action 3: Right engine firing. Helps to correct by pushing the craft to the left and counteracting left-side tilts.

5. **Scoring Implications**: Consistently firing the engines reduces the score. The center engine, being more power-intensive, reduces the score significantly (-0.3 points/frame), while the side engines reduce it by -0.03 points/frame. The goal is to achieve a delicate balance, using just enough thrust to control the descent and maintain alignment, but not more than necessary.

**Steps to a Successful Landing**:

1. **Minimize Lateral Movement**: Continuously correct X position to nearly zero using side engines (actions 1 and 3). Ensure X velocity is close to zero as you near the ground.

2. **Control Descent Speed**: Use the central engine (action 2) to control Y velocity, ensuring it‚Äôs not too fast. Gradually reduce the descent speed as you approach the landing zone.

3. **Maintain Vertical Orientation**: Keep the angle and angular velocity in check using side engines. Any small tilts should be corrected immediately to avoid instability.

4. **Conserve Fuel/Score**: Avoid unnecessary usage of the engines. Use no engines (action 0) when the spacecraft's position and velocity are within safe margins.

**General Strategy for Action Function**: The act function should implement logic that considers the current status of the spacecraft and makes decisions to optimize the descent, reducing velocity and correcting position/angle continuously. The function can have conditions to check the spacecraft's state and decide the most optimal action. Below is the implementation of this strategy in Python.

Analyze the performance of the spacecraft and how it differs from the desired result. Be guided by the scoring system. Identify the cause of errors in your code and modify it without fear of making major changes. Think deeply about the priorities of your code and how to order and combine them correctly to achieve success. Remember that the code is a reflection of your reasoning and the way you approach the problem.

Razonamiento:
In analyzing the given successful and unsuccessful landing attempts, several key observations and principles emerge about the environment and the actions taken. Here's a detailed breakdown: 

1. **Position (X and Y):** Successful landings gently oscillate around the landing zone (X position), and they steadily reduce their Y position towards the landing site.
2. **Velocity (X and Y):** Horizontal and vertical velocities should ideally be minimized. Vertical velocity should be small to ensure a soft landing. Increasing velocity results in negative scores and could cause crashes.
3. **Angle and Angular Velocity:** The spacecraft needs to be as vertical as possible (Angle close to 0), and angular velocity should be minimized. If the spacecraft is tilted, it could crash or land too harshly, hence penalized the score.
4. **Contact Sensors:** Successful landing should trigger both sensors (indicating flat landing) and is rewarded positively.
5. **Score Impact of Actions:** Using engines consumes score over time. Specifically, 0.03 points per frame for the side engines (1 and 3) and 0.3 points per frame for the center engine (2). However, these engines are necessary to adjust the descent.
6. **Engine Use:** Balancing the use of side and center engines is critical. Both engines should be utilized strategically for hovering and reducing X and Y velocities steadily. 

**Steps to follow for a successful landing:**
1. **Maintain Horizontal Position (X):** Gradually bring the X position towards zero, ensuring gentle corrections using side engines to balance horizontal drift.
2. **Control Vertical Position (Y):** Gradually decrease Y position with controlled use of the center engine to ensure soft landings. Avoid excessive downward velocity.
3. **Minimize Velocities:** Keep both X and Y velocities low. Slight adjustments with engines are necessary (primarily the center engine for vertical adjustments).
4. **Balance Angular Position and Velocity:** Keep the spacecraft as vertical as possible using side engines to avoid excessive tilts.
5. **Utilize Sensors:** Achieve both sensors triggered upon landing for a successful touchdown.

**Decision Code:** The revised logic carefully looks at each observation parameter and adjusts accordingly to maintain stability and soft descent. The act method will dynamically adjust engines based on the input state, using specified thresholds for movement adjustments.

Razonamiento:
To achieve a successful landing, several factors must be controlled in the observations: X position, Y position, X velocity, Y velocity, Angle, and Angular velocity. The closer the spacecraft is to the landing area (both axes), the better. The slower the spacecraft is moving (both X and Y velocities), the more stable the landing is. The spacecraft should also be as upright as possible (Angle close to 0), and the Angular velocity should be minimal.  Various actions affect these parameters as follows: Action 0: Switch off engines, typically resulting in the spacecraft continuing in its current motion due to inertia and gravity. Action 1: Push left engine, generally resulting in a slight turn to the right and a bit of thrust upward/left. Action 2: Push both engines (upwards), providing significant upward thrust to counteract downward momentum. Action 3: Push right engine, generally resulting in a slight turn to the left and a bit of thrust upward/right. Key observations from the successful log: Keep thrusting both engines (action 2) when the spacecraft is moving too fast downwards to slow it down. Use side engines (action 1 and 3) to correct horizontal positions and angles. From the unsuccessful log, it can be seen that random actions lead to uncontrolled descent and deviation from the landing zone, causing crashes. Improvements can be made by focusing on reducing horizontal velocity more quickly and starting to correct the descent earlier. Maintain a balance between horizontal and vertical stabilization. Final steps: Continue upward thrust when vertical speeds are high. side thrusts will be used to correct positions and angles. For the final phase, all engines should be switched off when close to the ground and within controlled movement parameters.

Razonamiento:
The previous implementation consistently fired the left engine, resulting in excessive tilting and angular velocity, leading eventually to a crash. Key observations include: 
1. The constant firing of the left engine (action 1) continuously increased angular velocity.
2. Vertical speed (Y velocity) increased negatively, resulting in a hard crash because a correct reduction in Y velocity wasn't prioritized.
3. Horizontal drift (X velocity) wasn't effectively countered, leading to increasing deviation from the desired vertical position.

Revised Plan: 
1. **Stabilize the spacecraft orientation**: Use side engines only to correct significant angles, then focus on orientation stability.
2. **Manage horizontal drift**: Use side engines briefly and only if necessary to adjust X velocity, counteracting drift while favoring minimal tilt changes.
3. **Control descent speed**: Use the main engine (action 2) judiciously to slow down descent when Y velocity becomes too negative.
4. **Conserve fuel**: Aim to switch off engines (action 0) whenever stable, reducing unnecessary scoring penalties.

New revised `act` function to reflect these steps:

Razonamiento:
To improve the results, we need to adjust the behavior of the spacecraft gradually by combining insights from the previous attempts and refining the conditions and thresholds based on the scoring principles. Here are the insights drawn and the refined approach:

1. **Control Use of Side Engines**: Adjust side engines less frequently to avoid excessive penalties. We should use these engines only when the position or velocity deviates significantly from our target range.

2. **Better Manage Y Velocity and Position**: Correct vertical descent more effectively to keep the Y velocity in a safer range as we near the ground. Implement a graded response so the central engine is activated only when descending too fast or too high.

3. **More Responsive Angle Adjustment**: Angle correction should be more dynamic to maintain vertical orientation. Small tilts should be corrected promptly without overusing the engines.

We‚Äôll also introduce an additional layer of decision-making for finer control as we approach the ground.

The refined code will have better-calibrated thresholds and conditions to balance stability, descent speed, and horizontal alignment.

Razonamiento:
Upon comparison of the logs and performance, several crucial differences are observed between the provided code with a score of -612.95 and the code that resulted in -1157.908. Key points for analysis and action include:

1. **Horizontal Velocity Management:** The successful code (still with a negative score) places a strong emphasis on managing horizontal velocity when above the threshold. The space utilization of engines is regimented to focus primarily on minimizing X velocities using side engines.
2. **Angular Management:** The threshold for adjusting angles seems lower than the original, focusing on rapid correction of angular tilts to prevent excessive tilt and associated penalties.
3. **Vertical Management:** The code triggers the center engine (upwards) only if the vertical velocity is below or above a set threshold, ensuring a steady descent while avoiding abrupt changes.
4. **Score Impact Awareness:** The code avoids excessive usage of either engine, reflecting both efficient fuel management and immersion with ground observation sensors towards final landing points.

Steps to modify the code effectively:
1. **Horizontal Position Correction:** Ensure the spacecraft maintains a nearly central landing position, restricting excessive horizontal velocity and minimizing X position updates.
2. **Angular Adjustment:** Enforce rigorous angle management to avoid penalties.
3. **Dedicated Vertical Updates:** Ensure a steady descent rate, avoiding high vertical velocity.
4. **Efficient Use of Engines:** Managing score by selectively employing engines acknowledging sensor inputs and ground contact.

Plan New Code Adjustments based on articulated principles, enhancing vertical velocity management and balancing overall behavior adjustment with defined thresholds.

Razonamiento:
Analyzing the best performing agent and the previously generated logs reveals several insights: 1. The priority should be controlling the X and Y velocities to ensure the spacecraft maintains a stable descent. 2. The angle and angular velocity must be kept as close to zero as possible to minimize tilting. 3. The horizontal position (X) must be adjusted to keep the spacecraft above the landing area. To start, the act function should first address the highest priority: the angle. If the spacecraft angle deviates significantly from zero, the spacecraft will tilt, leading to more complicated handling scenarios. Hence, it should be corrected first. Next, control the X velocity, followed by the Y velocity. Here is the refined reasoning: 1. Always correct the angle first to ensure stable descent. If the angle is beyond the acceptable threshold, use the side engines to correct it. 2. Control the X velocity to ensure the spacecraft doesn't drift out of the landing zone. Use lateral thrusts as necessary. 3. Control the Y position and velocity. Use upward thrust when descending too fast or when the Y position is still high. Finally, when velocity and angle corrections are satisfactory, switch off engines to maintain a controlled descent. Here's the revised function:

Razonamiento:
In the previous attempt, several issues still emerged, leading to a crash:
1. The spacecraft continuously tilted, causing significant angular and horizontal drift.
2. The descent speed remained high, resulting in a hard landing.
3. Both the left and right engines were overused without effectively stabilizing the spacecraft.

Key observations:
- Frequent side engine firings led to high angular velocity, causing instability.
- Not effectively addressing the descent speed with the main engine.
- The code prioritizes side engines based on angle rather than descent control.
- A comprehensive control over X position, Y position, and descent speed was missing.

Revised Plan:
1. **Stabilize Y velocity**: Maintain a safe descent speed by frequently controlling the main engine to prevent high negative Y velocities.
2. **Correct angles minimally**: Reduce unnecessary angle corrections unless critical to minimize angular velocity.
3. **Control X velocity sporadically**: Adjust horizontal drift only if significantly deviating.
4. **Sequential control**: Implement Y velocity control first, followed by dealing with angles, and lastly handling horizontal drift.

New revised `act` function to reflect these adjusted priorities:

Razonamiento:
Upon analyzing the previous attempts and the best result, the following refinements were made:

1. **Threshold Adjustment**: Adjusted the threshold for angle correction to be more responsive and the horizontal velocity correction to be more precise. Using finer control gaps will make the trajectory corrections smoother.
2. **Fall-through Control Logic**: Ensured logic that handles multiple conditions in a prioritized manner. For example, prioritize correcting the horizontal velocity and angle before adjusting vertical velocity.
3. **Dynamic State Handling**: Improved condition handling when descending closer to the ground. Allow finer control over vertical thrust to better manage descent and avoid hard landings.

These steps are implemented while keeping in mind the balance between using engines to correct the trajectory and minimizing points lost due to engine usage.

Razonamiento:
Upon comparison of logs and performance, the provided code with a score of -141.601 outperforms the previous codes significantly. Critical differences include:

1. **Prioritizing Angle Management:** The code emphasizes correcting the spacecraft's angle before addressing horizontal and vertical positions, minimizing penalties due to tilt.
2. **Dynamic Vertical Management:** The code introduces dynamic adjustments based on vertical position and velocity surpassing a certain threshold. This balances descent rate and moderate corrections.
3. **Conditional Horizontal Velocity Correction:** Horizontal velocity adjustments are secondary and made only if they cross set limits, ensuring horizontal stability while descent is controlled.
4. **Efficient Engine Control:** Smart engine prioritization reduces unnecessary fuel consumption, thus managing score impact efficiently.

Next Steps and Code Adjustment:
1. **Refinement of Prioritization:** Ensuring angle correction first, then managing vertical and horizontal velocities as a secondary priority, adjusting action returns based on sensor input.
2. **Balanced Control Thresholds:** Implementing fine-tuned control thresholds for vertical velocity and position to ensure smooth gentle landings, managing frame-by-frame state.
3. **Optimized Decision Logic in Incremental Steps:** Iterative updating based on environment responses, with goal-based validation to manage both short-term actions and long-term stability.

This approach aims for a balanced, optimized strategy for better performance and refined landing control in real-time scenarios.

Razonamiento:
To further improve and attempt to exceed the best result, we need to take a deeper look into the successful aspects and shortcomings of the provided code. The key observations and current parameters are: 1. Y position and Y velocity are prioritized, but the angle correction is lacking in efficiency. This shows that stability is crucial before adjusting other parameters when the spacecraft is too high or falling too quickly. 2. Angle correction should be more precise, and side, in cases of slight drift (correct only if there's uncoverable risk). 3. Center engines should be used efficiently and only when an overall slowdown is required. We need to balance the thrust applied to minimize the decrease in score due to engine usage. Step-by-step approach: 1. Detect excessive tilting and correct it. 2. Adjust X and Y velocities to limit drift. 3. Use upward thrusts only to slow descent if Y velocity is excessive. So, here is a refined approach to further improve the results.

Razonamiento:
The revised code produced better results, managing to stabilize the descent to an extent, but it still resulted in significant issues leading to a crash. Key observations include: 
1. Horizontal and angular corrections were not balanced properly, causing instability. 
2. Z-velocity control was better but still led to a high descent rate sometimes. 
3. Overuse of engines reduced score drastically in some steps and did not efficiently reduce velocities.

Key insights to improve the implementation further:
1. **Stabilize horizontal drift, Z-velocity, and angle sequentially but with optimized firing**: Balance the acts better while minimizing engine usage to reduce scoring penalties. 
2. **Optimize angle corrections**: Implement angle corrections with minimal side engine usage.  Implement conditions on the preexisting angle to prevent overuse leading to instability. 
3. **Overall optimization**: Limit engine usage to balance and prioritize key movements without excessively firing side engines.

Revised Strategy:
1. **Descent Speed Control**: Make sure vertical velocity is maintained within safe limits.
2. **Angular Stability**: Correct angle persistently but minimize continuous unnecessary engine use. 
3. **Balance Horizontal Drift**: Only adjust horizontal drift when required and minimize using engine firing where possible to minimize penalties.

Here is the new revised `act` function reflecting this strategy:

Razonamiento:
The code that achieved the best result primarily focused on a few key aspects: stabilizing descent speed, correcting angular tilt, and adjusting horizontal drift. However, there were still some areas where improvements could be made, especially regarding the efficient use of engines and the stabilization of descent at lower altitudes. Here's a breakdown of the current successful strategy and further refinements:

1. **Stabilize Descent**: Prioritize the use of the central engine to control the descent speed when the vertical velocity is too high.
2. **Correct Angular Tilt**: Apply corrections to the angular tilt only when it goes beyond a specific threshold, avoiding unnecessary adjustments that waste fuel/score.
3. **Adjust Horizontal Drift**: Correct the horizontal velocity to maintain a stable descent path, ensuring the spacecraft doesn‚Äôt drift too far horizontally.
4. **Engine Control Optimization**: Use conditions to decide when it's best to switch off engines to conserve score while ensuring safe descent.

A refined approach is to ensure these conditions are tightly controlled and that there is logic to handle different stages of descent more gracefully.

Razonamiento:
The key takeaways from the best-performing solution include stabilizing descent speed, correcting angular tilt, and horizontal drift. The performance difference between the best result and the current one stems from a disciplined prioritization and accurate application of corrections. Below is a modified implementation, focusing on an enhanced checkpoint system to control vertical descent, horizontal alignment, and tilting adjustments with conservative and strategic engine use. It ensures corrections are applied when absolutely necessary to maximize score retention while ensuring a safe descent. The code handles each aspect in order of priority, starting with vertical speed stabilization, then angular correction, and finally horizontal drift mitigation.

Upon comparing the logs and performance, here are the key takeaways from the best-performing code, which achieved a positive score of 10.327:

1. **Initial Stabilization of Descent Speed:** The code prioritizes reducing vertical velocity, ensuring the spacecraft doesn't descend too fast and maintains a controlled descent.
2. **Angular Correction when Significant:** The code addresses any significant angular deviations to prevent penalties from tilts during descent.
3. **Horizontal Drift Adjustment:** It ensures the spacecraft does not drift horizontally beyond set thresholds to maintain positioning relative to the landing spot.
4. **Efficient Management of Engine Usage:** The code selectively applies thrust actions based only on the conditions met, avoiding overuse of any engine and thus optimizing score balance.
5. **Thresholds and Prioritization:** Specific thresholds set for vertical velocity, horizontal velocity, and angle help manage each aspect of the descent efficiently, ensuring soft and balanced landing.

**Steps for Improvement:** To refine and improve our code further, we should iterate over our logic, set clear priorities, adjust actions dynamically based on continuous input state, and optimize threshold values to achieve balanced descent management and landing control systematically.

Adjusted code incorporates this learning to refine actions taken step-by-step ensuring balanced decision making.

Upon analyzing the comparison and updated logs, I identified an issue: the variable `y_velocity` used in the code is not directly derived from the `observation`. The correct variable extracted from `observation` is `y_vel`. This needs updating for correct implementation in the logic. Here, adjustments include appropriate thresholding and engine usage to balance vertical and horizontal velocities, angle correction, and minimal engine usage for increased efficiency in scoring.

Razonamiento:
The best result analyzed shows that the approach prioritizes stabilizing descent speed, correcting angular tilt, and adjusting horizontal drift satisfactorily. However, we can improve further by: 1. Ensuring the angle is within acceptable limits as a first priority. 2. Controlling vertical speed while also ensuring horizontal drift is within limits. 3. Using engine thrust efficiently to minimize score penalties. The revised step-by-step approach is: 1. Correct the descent speed if it is too fast. 2. Stabilize the angle within acceptable limits to prevent instability. 3. Adjust horizontal drift if significant. 4. Use minimal thrust necessary to achieve step 1-3 goals, keeping the rest of the parameters within acceptable thresholds. Finally, switch off engines if all parameters are within the acceptable range.

Analyze the performance of the spacecraft and how it differs from the desired result. Be guided by the scoring system. Identify the cause of errors in your code and modify it without fear of making major changes. Think deeply about the priorities of your code and how to order and combine them correctly to achieve success. Remember that the code is a reflection of your reasoning and the way you approach the problem.

Razonamiento:
Comparing the successful code with the previously provided code, a few key differences and improvements in the successful implementation stand out:
1. **Avoid Overuse of Engines**: The successful implementation avoids constant firing of side or main engines. Overuse was penalizing the scores drastically in the failed attempts.
2. **Descent Speed Control**: The successful implementation prioritizes maintaining a safe descent speed by firing the main engine (y_vel control) when needed more sparingly and switching off engines effectively when safe (lower unnecessary usage penalties).
3. **Angular Stability**: Angular corrections are governed within a specific threshold providing balance, albeit minimally - there was better management and restrictions in tilting corrections leading to lesser penalties compared to non-successful codes.
4. **Success Factors in Actions**: The use of threshold values balanced across velocity and position adjustments limits unnecessary penalties by accurate stability and correction iterations.

The task is to replicate these key adjustments while balancing across all the attributes judiciously and effectively to avoid consistent penalties. Here is an elongated generative design for the `act` function to include the thresholds successively balanced:

Analyze the performance of the spacecraft and how it differs from the desired result. Be guided by the scoring system. Identify the cause of errors in your code and modify it without fear of making major changes. Think deeply about the priorities of your code and how to order and combine them correctly to achieve success. Remember that the code is a reflection of your reasoning and the way you approach the problem.

Razonamiento:
The spacecraft's performance in this attempt was better but still suboptimal in key areas such as proper descent speed stabilization and angle correction, especially near the end of the descent. The successful descent requires more refining to ensure that engines are used efficiently and corrections are timely and precise. Here are the changes and reasoning for further improvement: 

1. **Enhanced Descent Speed Control**: Increase the use of the central engine when the descent speed is high and switch it off earlier as the speed stabilizes to conserve points.

2. **Tighten Angle Correction**: Ensure angle adjustments are prompt and balanced to avoid excessive tilting and corrections.

3. **Horizontal Drift Adjustments**: Fine-tune how horizontal velocities are corrected to avoid drifting either too slowly or too rapidly.

Using these insights, the refined code is as follows:

Razonamiento:
Upon analyzing the provided best-performing code and reviewing the given logs, several elements contributed to its success:

1. **Efficient Stabilization of Descent:** Early focus on stabilizing the vertical velocity. The threshold set for descent ensures the spacecraft doesn't accelerate downwards uncontrollably.
2. **Rigorous Angle Adjustment:** Ensuring angular stability minimizes penalties and enables a more controlled descent.
3. **Horizontal Velocity Management:** Addressing horizontal drift when thresholds are exceeded keeps the spacecraft aligned with the landing target.
4. **Engine Utilization Efficiency:** By minimizing unnecessary engine usage, the code optimally balances the score, ensuring gradual and balanced descent.
5. **Landing Contact Handling:** An explicit check for both sensors being triggered ensures engines are switched off immediately once a safe landing is detected.

### Adjusted Code for Optimal Performance

To fine-tune and enhance the performance, the following code incorporates balanced, incremental updates based on continuous monitoring of observation parameters, asserting maintaining angles, velocities, and positions consistently within thresholds to achieve a successful landing.

Razonamiento:
Analyzing the best performing agent shows that the approach effectively balances descent speed, angle correction, and horizontal drift management. Additionally, it includes an improvement by turning off engines once landed. The final conclusions are: 1. Prioritize stabilizing the descent speed first if it's too fast. 2. Correct angular tilt if it's significant. 3. Adjust horizontal drift if necessary. 4. Turn off engines if landed. The revised approach ensures efficient thrust usage and minimal penalties while maintaining stability.

Razonamiento:
From the logs, several key series of events have significant implications for successfully landing the spacecraft. Let's break down our observations and action effects:

1. **Actions**:
   - Action 0: Switch off engines, this action helps to conserve the spacecraft‚Äôs momentum but doesn't alter the velocity other than the natural gravitational pull.
   - Action 1: Push left engine, this action tilts the spacecraft counterclockwise and slightly affects the horizontal velocity.
   - Action 2: Push upward with both engines. It significantly slows down the vertical speed and has minor effects on the spacecraft position.
   - Action 3: Push right engine, this action tilts the spacecraft clockwise, adjusting the angular velocity and slightly affecting the horizontal velocity.

2. **Current Status**:
   - The X position and Y position are essential for determining how close the spacecraft is to the landing zone.
   - X velocity and Y velocity need to be minimized for a smoother landing. The spacecraft should achieve a low horizontal and vertical speed.
   - Angle and Angular velocity should also be minimized to prevent tilts during landing.

3. **Key Observations and Predictions**
   - High vertical speed before firing engines results in significant losing points.
   - Horizontal drifts or changes primarily occur due to side engines (actions 1 and 3).
   - Continually pushing both engines (upward) action 2 slows down both velocities (X and Y) and can help achieve a suitable vertical descent speed.
   - Minimal tilt is maintained around zero for a better landing score.

**Plan**:
   - Use both engines (action 2) universally to slow down descent until vertical speed is adequately reduced.
   - Use side engines (actions 1 and 3) on a need basis to correct angular deviations and horizontal velocity.
   - Avoid turning off engines (action 0) unless in rare cases where further correction is not urgently needed.

Steps to follow:
   - Monitor the vertical and horizontal speed closely.
   - Use action 2 consistently to reduce vertical speed and stabilize descent.
   - Apply small corrections using action 1 or 3 to ensure alignment with minimal tilt near zero angle and centro-angular velocity.
   - Turn off engines toward the final landing stages if speed is low and within a safe range to avoid unnecessary fuel usage and optimize score.

Razonamiento:
From the logs, several key series of events have significant implications for successfully landing the spacecraft. Let's break down our observations and action effects:

1. **Actions**:
   - Action 0: Switch off engines, helps conserve the spacecraft‚Äôs momentum but doesn't alter the velocity significantly other than due to natural gravitational pull.
   - Action 1: Push left engine, tilts the spacecraft counterclockwise and slightly affects the horizontal velocity.
   - Action 2: Push upward with both engines, significantly slows down vertical speed and helps stabilize descent.
   - Action 3: Push right engine, tilts the spacecraft clockwise and slightly affects the horizontal velocity.

2. **Current Status**:
   - The X position and Y position are essential for determining proximity to the landing zone.
   - X velocity and Y velocity need to be minimized for a smoother landing. The spacecraft should achieve low horizontal and vertical speed.
   - Angle and Angular velocity should be minimized to prevent tilts.

3. **Key Observations and Predictions**:
   - High vertical speed before firing engines results in significant loss of points.
   - Horizontal drifts or changes occur primarily due to side engines (actions 1 and 3).
   - Regular use of both engines (action 2) slows down both velocities (X and Y) and can help achieve a suitable vertical descent speed.
   - Maintaining minimal tilt is key for a better landing score.

**Plan**:
   - Use both engines (action 2) universally to slow down descent until vertical speed is adequately reduced.
   - Use side engines (actions 1 and 3) as needed to correct angular deviations and horizontal velocity.
   - Avoid turning off engines (action 0) unless speed correction is not urgently required.

Steps to follow:
   - Monitor vertical and horizontal speed closely.
   - Use action 2 consistently to reduce vertical speed and stabilize descent.
   - Apply small corrections using action 1 or 3 to ensure alignment with minimal tilt near zero angle and minimal angular velocity.
   - Turn off engines towards the final landing stages if speed is low and within a safe range to avoid unnecessary fuel usage and optimize score.

To achieve a successful landing, understanding the influence of each action on the spacecraft's state is critical. Here's a step-by-step reasoning process to understand and improve the landing strategy:

1. Initial values and what they represent:
    - `X position`: Horizontal position relative to the landing zone.
    - `Y position`: Vertical position relative to the landing zone.
    - `X velocity`: Horizontal velocity of the spacecraft.
    - `Y velocity`: Vertical velocity of the spacecraft.
    - `Angle`: Angular tilt of the spacecraft (left negative, right positive).
    - `Angular velocity`: Rate of change of the angle.
    - `Left contact sensor` & `Right contact sensor`: Binary indicators of contact with the landing zone.

2. Effects of Actions:
    - `0`: Switch off engines. Maintains current velocity while applying gravity.
    - `1`: Push left engine. Reduces `X velocity` and changes `angle` counterclockwise.
    - `2`: Push both engines (upwards). Reduces `Y velocity` and helps control descent.
    - `3`: Push right engine. Increases `X velocity` and changes `angle` clockwise.

3. Ideal conditions for successful landing:
    - Position: Centered over the landing zone (`X position` close to 0).
    - Velocity: Slow horizontal and vertical velocities (`X velocity` & `Y velocity` close to 0).
    - Angle: Near vertical orientation (`Angle` close to 0).

4. Observations from Sample Logs:
    - Strategies performing well included actions that balanced velocities and maintained stability (minimal angular velocity).
    - Frequent usage of `action = 2` to control vertical descent.
    - Correctly timed usage of `action = 1` and `action = 3` to adjust horizontal position and angular tilt.

5. Strategy for improving the code:
    - Use `action = 2` to reduce `Y velocity` effectively.
    - Fine-tune `X velocity` using `action = 1` and `action = 3` to center the spacecraft horizontally.
    - Maintain orientation by ensuring `angle` remains near zero using an appropriate mix of actions.

With this reasoning, we can update the `act` function using a more deterministic approach instead of random actions to ensure better control over the spacecraft's state and maximize the landing score.

Razonamiento:
To achieve a successful landing, the spacecraft must be close to the landing zone, moving slowly, minimally tilted, and either have the engines off or using minimal thrust to fine-tune the descent. Let's break down each parameter and how actions affect them:

1. **X position (0)** and **Y position (1)**: These indicate the spacecraft's horizontal and vertical positions. The closer these values are to 0, the nearer the spacecraft is to the landing zone. Maintaining control over X and Y positions is crucial for positioning correctly above the landing zone.

2. **X velocity (2)** and **Y velocity (3)**: These indicate velocities in horizontal and vertical directions. Lower magnitudes are desired (closer to 0), as they signify slower speeds which are safer for landing.

3. **Angle (4)**: The angle of the spacecraft relative to the vertical. A value close to 0 is desirable as it indicates the spacecraft is upright. Too much tilt can cause an unfit landing.

4. **Angular velocity (5)**: The rate of change of the spacecraft's angle. It should be minimized (close to 0), indicating stable positioning free from tilting.

5. **Left (6) and Right (7) contact sensor**: These sensors show if the spacecraft is in contact with the landing zone on the left and right. They should both be 1 for a successful landing.

### Actions and Their Effects:
1. **0: Switch off engines**: No thrust. The spacecraft will naturally decelerate due to gravity unless angular velocity causes it to spin.

2. **1: Push left engine**: Causes a thrust on the left side, making the spacecraft tilt to the right and move right horizontally. It decelerates X and Y velocity.

3. **2: Push both engines (upwards)**: Creates upward thrust, reducing Y velocity and potentially decelerating the descent. Slight effect on X velocity due to balancing.

4. **3: Push right engine**: Creates thrust on the right side, making the spacecraft tilt to the left and move left horizontally. It decelerates X and Y velocity.

### Steps to Follow for Successful Landing:
1. **Descent Control**: Push both engines (Action 2) periodically to reduce descent velocity. Use action 0 when closer to the ground to avoid excessive use of central engine thrust (which impacts the score negatively). Maintain a controlled descent speed.

2. **Horizontal Alignment**: Use actions 1 and 3 to adjust horizontal position to ensure the spacecraft is above the landing zone. Alternate between left and right engines to adjust X position carefully, aiming for zero X velocity.

3. **Stabilize Tilts**: Monitor the angle and angular velocity. Use left and right engines (actions 1 and 3) to counteract tilting. Maintain a minimal angle value close to 0.

4. **Final Approach**: As the spacecraft nears the ground, minimize all velocities and the angle. Aim to switch off the engines (action 0) for the final frames to achieve both contact sensors indicating a stable touchdown.

### Implementing the Code:
Based on the reasoning, the act function should consider current velocities, positions, angle, and angular velocity to decide the appropriate action. The focus should be on maintaining upright positioning, minimal velocities (both linear and angular), and aligning over the landing zone.

### Pre-coding Deep Reasoning on Log Analysis and Influence of Actions on Observations: 

#### Current understanding from the successful landing record: 
The log shows various steps of actions and the evolving state of the spacecraft during the landing attempt. The key observations and their changes mean the following:

- **X Position** and **Y Position**: Indicate the spacecraft‚Äôs current horizontal and vertical positions relative to the landing zone. Ideally, X Position should be close to 0 for a centered approach.

- **X Velocity** and **Y Velocity**: Indicate the horizontal and vertical speeds of the spacecraft. Slower speeds are preferable, especially near landing.

- **Angle**: Indicates how tilted the spacecraft is. An angle close to 0 degrees (vertical) is ideal for landing.

- **Angular Velocity**: The rate of change of the spacecraft‚Äôs angle. Lower values are desired to avoid unstable oscillations near the landing phase.

- **Left and Right Contact Sensors**: These provide binary feedback (0 or 1) on whether the spacecraft is in touch with the landing surface on the respective sides.

#### Effects of each action:
1. **Switch off engines (0)**: No thrust applied; the spacecraft continues with its current velocities. Useful during stable descent or when no corrections are needed.

2. **Push left engine (1)**: Fires the left engine; nudges the spacecraft to the right and counteracts rightward tilt.

3. **Push both engines downward/upward (2)**: Applies thrust upwards; slows down the descent rate (Y velocity) and can stabilize fall speed.

4. **Push right engine (3)**: Fires the right engine; nudges the spacecraft to the left and counteracts leftward tilt.

#### Steps to Achieve a Successful Landing:
1. **Stabilization**: Maintain a near-zero angle and minimal angular velocity to prevent excessive tilting.

2. **Velocity Control**: Manage X and Y velocities to ensure a controlled descent, favoring gradual speed reduction in Y velocity and minimal horizontal drifts in X velocity.

3. **Centering**: Use the left and right thrusters to keep X Position centered, ensuring that the spacecraft does not drift too much horizontally.

4. **Landing Approach**: Lower Y velocity safely as approach height decreases to avoid abrupt impacts and to align vertically.

By integrating these steps, we can form a more deterministic approach in the `act` function rather than random actions to maximize the scoring criteria provided.

Razonamiento:
The spacecraft's state is represented by several key values: X position, Y position, X velocity, Y velocity, angle, angular velocity, left contact sensor, and right contact sensor. The objective is to achieve a gentle, upright landing within a specified horizontal and vertical range, with minimal velocity and no tilt. Here's a breakdown of the influence of each action on the spacecraft:
- '0': Switch off engines ‚Äì allows the spacecraft to fall naturally. X and Y velocities may increase due to gravity and momentum. 
- '1': Push left engine ‚Äì generates a rightward force, affecting X velocity, Y velocity slightly (due to upward thrust), and angular velocity (clockwise rotation). 
- '2': Push both engines (upwards) ‚Äì primarily affects Y velocity (reduces the descent rate) and stabilizes angular velocity. X velocity is minimally affected. 
- '3': Push right engine ‚Äì generates a leftward force, affecting X velocity, Y velocity slightly (due to upward thrust), and angular velocity (counter-clockwise rotation).
The strategy to achieve a successful landing includes:
1. Minimizing horizontal velocity to keep within the horizontal bounds of the landing area.
2. Regulating vertical velocity to ensure a smooth descent.
3. Continuously correcting the angle to maintain an upright position.
4. Using the '2' action (both engines) to reduce vertical velocity and control descent, while using actions '1' and '3' to correct horizontal velocity and angular tilt as needed.
5. Reducing engine usage to conserve score points, balancing gentle thrusts with the need for corrections.
These steps will be encoded into the act function, calculating required corrections based on current state observations, and determining optimal actions. The function will prioritize keeping the spacecraft direct and hovering over the target, ensuring a smooth and controlled descent with minimal tilt.

Razonamiento:
Comparing the best result with the recent failed attempt shows some key differences in the code logic and decision hierarchy that could have led to the improved outcome in the successful attempt. The best code uses specific thresholds to decide when to activate certain thrusters, which aids in minimizing the oscillations and maintaining stability. Here are the critical takeaways and improved strategy for developing a more effective approach for the 'act' function:

1. **Angle Control and Stability**: The best attempt includes a defined threshold for angle correction. Keeping the angle within acceptable limits is necessary for stability.
2. **Velocity Management**: Both vertical and horizontal velocities are controlled via conditional checks, with specific thresholds to aim to reduce oscillations and maintain the desired trajectory.
3. **Prioritize Vertical Descent Control**: Ensure the downward velocity is controlled effectively before addressing horizontal stabilization.
4. **Use Gradual Adjustments**: Avoid sudden, excessive shifts in direction by applying smooth and gradual control measures.
5. **Decision Hierarchy**: Prioritize actions that stabilize the vehicle while complying with the environment constraints. For example, control the angle first if deviated significantly, then manage vertical descent, and finally adjust horizontal positioning.

With this refined understanding, here is how the improved code would look:

Analyze the performance of the spacecraft and how it differs from the desired result. Be guided by the scoring system. Identify the cause of errors in your code and modify it without fear of making major changes. Think deeply about the priorities of your code and how to order and combine them correctly to achieve success. Remember that the code is a reflection of your reasoning and the way you approach the problem.

Razonamiento:
Upon analyzing the provided logs, I noticed the following issues with the initial code and execution of the spacecraft landing strategy:

1. **Excessive Lateral Movement**: The spacecraft exhibits excessive horizontal movement due to too frequent activation of side engines. This increases the X velocity, leading to instability.

2. **Inconsistent Use of Engines**: The vertical speed is not controlled effectively. The code sometimes fires the upward engines even when it isn't necessary, reducing control over the descent speed and scoring negatively.

3. **Improper Angle Management**: The spacecraft has faced difficulties in maintaining a stable angle, leading to periodic corrections that degrade the score.

4. **Premature Activation of Side Engines**: The side engines are activated prematurely and too frequently, causing further lateral instability and angular momentum changes.

### Improved Approach
1. **Control X Position Only When Necessary**: Use side engines sparingly to avoid aggressive horizontal movement. Prioritize reducing X velocity only when it significantly deviates from the desired stable value.

2. **Stabilize Descent**: Focus on controlling vertical velocity slightly negative (downwards) and regular upward thrusts to manage descent effectively without excessive use of the central engine.

3. **Fine-Tune Angle Control**: Maintain a near-zero angle by using side engines only when the angle deviates from the threshold range.

4. **Prioritize Central Engine Use for Adjusting Descent**: Use upward thrusts primarily to manage vertical speed, only using side engines when necessary to correct lateral movements or angle deviations.

### Revised Code:
This revised code integrates these priorities and sets a more structured hierarchy for using engines while landing. The spacecraft should perform better by managing descent smoothly and stabilizing its orientation more efficiently.

Analyze the performance of the spacecraft and how it differs from the desired result. Be guided by the scoring system. Identify the cause of errors in your code and modify it without fear of making major changes. Think deeply about the priorities of your code and how to order and combine them correctly to achieve success. Remember that the code is a reflection of your reasoning and the way you approach the problem.

### Detailed Analysis and Substantive Improvement

#### Analysis of Past Performance:

From the logs provided, we can identify certain key trends that indicate failures and areas needing adjustments:

1. **Excessive Stability Maintenance (General Switching Off Engines)**:
   - In my initial implementation, the spacecraft remained mostly passive (engines off), causing it to continue its perilous vertical descent. This approach lacked active corrections leading to a crash.
   - Key Indicator: The observations showed stable horizontal movements and consistent downward vertical speed increases.

2. **Instability on Angle and High Vertical Speeds**:
   - The best previous code (`-141.415`) had persistent angle instability (angled spacecraft) and high vertical speeds due to overacting to angular/angular velocity adjustments.
   - Key Indicator: High vertical speeds (`y_vel`) and unstable angle (`angle`) leading to rapid undesirable descents.

#### Steps to Improve:
1. **Initial Stability Correction (Angle and Y Velocity)**:
   - Implement early correction for angle violations beyond a small threshold and consistently balance during descent.
   - Gradually slow down vertical velocity aggressively from the beginning to ensure controlled descent.
   - Particularly focus on `ang_vel` correction and maintain a near-zero angle.

2. **Continuous Position Centering (X Position and Velocity)**:
   - Implement continuous correction of X position within small thresholds for more gradual horizontal drifts.
   - Constantly rebalance horizontally to ensure centering around the target zone.

#### Revised Code Approach:
Integrate dynamic, step-wise decisions balancing angles, vertical velocities, and rebalancing horizontal drifts. Emphasis will be on steady progress towards reducing error margins for approach and landing.

1. Detect if within small favorable margins, else apply active corrections.
2. Favor thrust to prevent rapid descents, angle variations, and horizontal drifts from destabilizing the landing.

Razonamiento:
Based on the observations from the better-performing script, here are the steps to draw conclusions and enhance the current strategy:

1. **Error Analysis:** In the previous logs, the continual thrust in a single direction for angle correction caused unnecessary tilting. Moreover, the failure to balance horizontal and vertical velocities properly led to further decline in scores.

2. **Better Structuring Decisions:** The successful code also emphasizes minimizing horizontal velocity more effectively and consistently applying minor corrective thrusts.

3. **Simplified Prioritization:** The prior successful script uses thresholds for critical variables like vertical and horizontal velocities, angle correction, and applies thrust only when necessary.

4. **Enhanced Angle Correction:** The previous code emphasizes correcting angular velocity and angle efficiently, distributing forces over time.

5. **Consistent Implementation:** Ensure the thresholds for decisions are sensible and adhered to effectively throughout landing phases.

To improve the current code, the following changes are now considered: 
  - Incorporate thresholds more effectively.
  - Apply smaller corrective actions to prevent overcompensation.
  - Balance decisions regarding vertical and horizontal corrections better.

The improved code including the outlined enhancements is:

Analyze the performance of the spacecraft and how it differs from the desired result. Be guided by the scoring system. Identify the cause of errors in your code and modify it without fear of making major changes. Think deeply about the priorities of your code and how to order and combine them correctly to achieve success. Remember that the code is a reflection of your reasoning and the way you approach the problem.

Razonamiento:
Upon examining the successful logs and the corresponding code, several key takeaways can be highlighted to improve the action policy:

1. **Threshold Adjustments**: Recent values for angle, velocity, and angular velocity thresholds are crucial in determining action success. Precise threshold values stabilize both horizontal and vertical speeds.

2. **Handling Angles and Angular Velocities**: Both angular velocity and angle should influence engine activation, as they maintain alignment with the landing zone.

3. **Focus on X and Y Velocity**: Negative Y velocity is controlled effectively by upward thrust while the X velocity is managed to keep lateral movement minimal. Specific thresholds for these adjustments result in better control.

4. **Combining Actions Rationally**: Decisions like applying upward thrust or lateral thrusters should be based on real-time velocity and position parameters to counteract oscillations.

5. **Default to No Thrust When Stable**: Turning off engines avoids unnecessary scoring losses and maintains fuel efficiency.

Here's an improved code step-by-step based on these insights:

Razonamiento:
The most recent logs reveal that while there are improvements in some respects with occasional control of the spacecraft descent, there remain significant issues, particularly regarding angular velocity and excessive lateral movement.

1. **Excessive Angular Movement**: The code fails to address the rapid increase in angular velocity mid-descent leading to significant tilt issues that destabilize the spacecraft's trajectory and cause penalty scores.

2. **Failure to Minimize Use of Side Engines**: Overuse of side engines causes unwanted X position changes, making lateral control unstable and further contributing to angle deviations.

3. **Vertical Speed Control**: Vertical speed management improved, but still needed fine-tuning at a slower rate to be stable throughout the trajectory.

### Revised Approach
1. **Angle and Angular Velocity Management**: Always prioritize stabilizing the angle and minimizing angular velocity using side engines when even slightest deviations occur, reducing or halting lateral movements unless absolutely necessary.

2. **Controlled Descent with Upward Thrusts**: Apply short bursts of central/upward thrust to control the vertical speed at a more neutral velocity to buy time for angle adjustments and minimize penalties.

3. **Strategic Use of Side Engines**: To mitigate unnecessary lateral movement, only slightly adjust X velocity when it deviates beyond a much safer margin enabling better descent control.

4. **Prioritized Actions**: Define exact priorities: first handle immediate critical angles and angular velocities, then manage vertical descent, lastly address lateral movements if they dangerously deviate.

### New Action Function Code:
Modified with strictly defined priorities in mind.

### Analysis and Improvement Steps

#### Analysis of Previous Best and My Code

Upon evaluating the best performing and my recent attempt, the differences are clear in terms of stability and controlling descent:

1. **Stabilization (Angle and Horizontal Movements)**:
   - The best code effectively maintains smaller and progressive corrections, thus ensuring better angular stability and less drastic y_velocity corrections.
   - My code overcorrected, leading to high y_velocity and a downward spiral.

2. **Thrust Management**:
   - Best code has more conservative and minimal thrust applications, avoiding constant excessive thrust, reducing fuel use, and preventing further instability.
   - My code repeatedly activated engines, both in excessive and hard corrections.

### Steps to Incorporate for Improvement:

1. **Reduced Overcorrection:** Adjust thresholds and response strengths to ensure gradual descent and reduced angular corrections.
2. **Thrust Minimization:** Focus on minimal thrust activation by prioritizing fuel-efficient corrections, as stability will naturally prevent vertical and angular instability.
3. **Position Balancing:** Integrate steadier balancing movements to bring horizontal position closer without drastic drift prevention.
4. **Consistent Actions:** Use consistent actions within critical thresholds and use safe fall rates for corrections leading to steady descent.

### Updated Code to Integrate Lessons:

```python
import numpy as np

def act(observation):
    x, y, vx, vy, angle, angular_velocity, left_contact, right_contact = observation

    # Constants
    ANGLE_THRESHOLD = 0.05
    MAX_Y_VELOCITY = -0.3
    SAFE_X_VELOCITY = 0.2
    MAX_ANGULAR_VELOCITY = 0.1

    # Successful landing conditions
    if left_contact == 1 and right_contact == 1:
        return 0  # The spacecraft has landed

    # Correct y_velocity
    if vy < MAX_Y_VELOCITY:
        return 2  # Apply upward thrust to control descent speed

    # Correct angular position
    if abs(angle) > ANGLE_THRESHOLD:
        if angle > 0:
            return 3  # Thrust right engine to correct left
        else:
            return 1  # Thrust left to correct right tilt

    # Correct horizontal velocity
    if abs(vx) > SAFE_X_VELOCITY:
        if vx > 0:
            return 1  # Apply thrust to left engine to reduce positive X velocity
        else:
            return 3  # Apply thrust to right engine to reduce negative X velocity

    # Correct angular velocity
    if abs(ang_velocity) > MAX_ANGULAR_VELOCITY:
        if ang_velocity > 0: 
            return 1  # Apply thrust to left engine to counteract rightward spin
        else:
            return 3  # Apply thrust to right engine to counteract leftward spin

    # Default action - engines off
    return 0
```

Analyze the performance of the spacecraft and how it differs from the desired result. Be guided by the scoring system. Identify the cause of errors in your code and modify it without fear of making major changes. Think deeply about the priorities of your code and how to order and combine them correctly to achieve success. Remember that the code is a reflection of your reasoning and the way you approach the problem.

Razonamiento:
The key to the best-performing code lies in its careful balance between various thresholds and the focus on correcting undesirable states of the spacecraft. Here are the improvements over the previous approach:
 
1. **Thresholds for Corrective Actions**: This approach uses detailed thresholds for Y velocity, X velocity, angle, and angular velocity to make corrective actions when they are significant enough to influence landing safety.
2. **Order of Priorities**: It addresses urgent corrective actions (like large angles and high velocities) before less critical adjustments (like minor velocity corrections), ensuring more pressing issues are handled first.
3. **Safe Velocity Conditions**: It integrates different velocity conditions for safe landing, one for critical deceleration (when velocities are dangerously high) and one for safer deceleration, ensuring thrust usage only when necessary.
4. **Broad Scope Conditions**: The conditions aren't too strict, allowing for broader ranges where no action is necessary, thus reducing unnecessary thrust and better conserving score.
5. **Fine Angle Adjustment**: The effective handling of angular adjustments helps maintain a stable descent without excessive tilting.
Given this, the new code will reflect these key points, leading to an optimized landing behavior that aims to balance all factors comprehensively, integrating priorities effectively to achieve controlled, stable landings.
Here is the re-generated improved code:

Razonamiento:
Analyzing the logs and performance, here are the main takeaways and actionable improvements to align the code closely with the desired results:

1. **Angle and Angular Velocity Control**: Excessive angle and angular velocity control were among the better-performing aspects. The thresholds can be adjusted dynamically based on the descent phase.

2. **Vertical and Horizontal Velocity Management**: Controlled adjustments to velocity were effective in ensuring a safe descent. Safe thresholds were correctly set and actions were appropriately directed upon crossing these thresholds.

3. **Gradual Correction vs. Sudden Correction**: Frequent and aggressive corrections using lateral thrusters caused higher oscillations in the descent path. Gradual corrections with feedback control on oscillations must be considered.

4. **Turn off Engines When Stable**: Efficiently switching off engines when in stable descent state conserves fuel and minimizes points loss due to unnecessary thrust.

Next, let's refine the code by focusing on the critical steps and balances effectively:

Razonamiento:
After reviewing the logs of the previously successful code and comparing them with the last set of logs, it is clear there were significant improvements under earlier vertical speed and angle control strategies. However, there were still some issues with the execution of side engine thrust leading to unnecessary penalties. Here are the key differences and strategies for successful landing focusing on the proper prioritization and utilization of each action.

## Prior_issue‚Äôs Identification:
  1. **Angle and Angular Velocity**: Firing side engines helps manage gradients on angle changes, intermittent use for small angle and angular corrections.
  2. **Min_Control of Horizontal Movement**: Ensures negligible lateral movement by only firing when horizontal speed surpasses given bounds.
  3.  **Vertical Speed Control**: Maintain the primary control using center engines periodically for vertical control velocity management, adjusting engine firing within ‚Äòsafe descent velocity‚Äô.
  4.  **Prioritize Upward Thrust for Successful Descent**: Implement sequences that primarily focus on vertical control before angle or angular until close to ground.
  5.  **Optimized Conditions**: Organize hierarchical actions ensuring minimal use of engines without sacrificing control, take small corrections minimizing penalties far from landing zone, ensuring spacecraft controlled descent

## Essential Steps in Code Modifications:
- **Optimized Thresholds**: Redefine improved thresholds tuned towards spacecraft maintaining stable flight paths.
- **Action Implementation**: Structured hierarchical priority sequence ensuring only effective engine usage used prevent penalties due unnecessary thrusts firing horizontal/angle control entering order.
- **Full Code Optimization**: Implement full corrections optimizing timestep prioritizations for successful landing.

## Revised Action Implementation Code:

Revising code based on previous analysis logs identifying implementations step prioritizing actions necessary for maximized successful/penalty-free descent outcomes.

### Analysis and Improvement Steps

#### Analysis of Provided Best Code and My Last Code

Upon comparing my last implementation with the provided best code, here are some key takeaways and differences:

1. **Initialization and Immediate Response**:
   - The best code takes immediate and consistent actions to stabilize the descent (vertical and horizontal) from the start.
   - My code had excessive corrections leading to high descent velocity and instability.

2. **Thrust Management**:
   - The best code ensures minimal and necessary thrust to keep the spacecraft's descent controlled while conserving fuel.
   - My last code was heavily thrust-active with inconsistent patterns, leading to rapid undesirable descent.

3. **Balancing State Corrections**:
   - The best code balances the correction of angle, velocity, and position in a symbiotic manner preventing drastic state deviations.
   - My last code often overcorrected specific states without balancing resulting in exacerbated state destabilization.

### Steps to Improve:

1. **Introduce Incremental angle corrections and velocity control:** Stabilizing consistently avoiding large angle movements.
2. **Reduce abrupt high-thrust applications:** Avoid larger instant corrections but focus on gradual adjustments.
3. **Integrate better Default Inaction Handling:** Maintain stasis when no immediate thrust correction significantly improves.
4. **Incorporate Symbiotic State Management:** Controlled transitions handling angle, horizontally with vertical descent velocity more synchronized approach.

### Improved Code

```python
import numpy as np

def act(observation):
    x_pos, y_pos, x_vel, y_vel, angle, ang_vel, left_contact, right_contact = observation

    # Constants for thresholds and actions
    MIN_ANGLE = -0.1
    MAX_ANGLE = 0.1
    SAFE_Y_VELOCITY = -0.5
    SAFE_X_VELOCITY = 0.1
    MAX_X_VELOCITY = 0.03
    MAX_ANGULAR_VELOCITY = 0.1

    # Successful landing conditions
    if left_contact == 1 and right_contact == 1:
        return 0  # The spacecraft has landed

    # Control vertical descent
    if y_vel < SAFE_Y_VELOCITY:
        return 2  # Apply upward thrust to control descent speed

    # Control angle
    if abs(angle) > MAX_ANGLE:
        if angle > 0:
            return 3  # Thrust right engine to correct to the left
        else:
            return 1  # Thrust left engine to correct to the right

    # Control horizontal velocity
    if abs(x_vel) > SAFE_X_VELOCITY:
        if x_vel > 0:
            return 1  # Apply thrust to the left engine to reduce positive X velocity
        else:
            return 3  # Apply thrust to the right engine to reduce negative X velocity

    # Control angular velocity
    if abs(ang_vel) > MAX_ANGULAR_VELOCITY:
        if ang_vel > 0:
            return 1  # Apply thrust to the left engine to counter the right spin
        else:
            return 3  # Apply thrust to the right engine to counter the left spin

    # Default action is to switch off engines to conserve fuel and minimize sudden movements
    return 0
```

Razonamiento:
Analyzing the performance of the spacecraft using the logs of a successful landing attempt with a score of 5.529 and comparing it with previous attempts, the following conclusions can be drawn:
1. **Consistent Thrust for Correction**: The successful approach involves consistent, minimal thrusts to correct angles and velocities, avoiding abrupt and large thrusts that can destabilize the spacecraft.
2. **Fine-Tuning Velocities**: The decision thresholds for velocities and angles provide sufficient flexibility to handle minor deviations while maintaining stability. This ensures the spacecraft remains within safe velocity bounds without excessive corrections.
3. **Efficient Descent Control**: The decision to apply upward thrust primarily for controlling descent speed (y_velocity < SAFE_Y_VELOCITY) ensures a controlled and smooth landing.
4. **Preserved Score**: The default action to switch off engines conserves fuel and minimizes unnecessary score penalties, enhancing the overall score.
Based on these insights, the following step-by-step refined code addresses these points more precisely, maintaining a balance between corrective actions and fuel/score conservation:
- **Maintain Vertical Control**: Prioritize vertical descent control to maintain safe speeds.
- **Ensure Angular Stability**: Correct angles efficiently to ensure upright landing.
- **Control Horizontal Velocities**: Ensure horizontal movements are within safe bounds.
- **Optimize Fuel Usage**: Default to engine off to conserve score points when no immediate corrections are needed.
Here is the enhanced code incorporating these observations:

Razonamiento:
Upon analyzing the logs and comparing them with the successful landing scenario, a few critical observations stand out:

1. **Consistent Use of Thrust**: The spacecraft seems to over-rely on the left engine (action `1`), leading to high positive angular velocities and unstable descent paths.

2. **Late Angle and Angular Velocity Corrections**: Frequent and aggressive corrections reflect delayed responses to angular deviations and velocities.

3. **Balanced Y-Velocity Control**: Effective control of vertical descent is essential for managing soft landings. Overuse of thrust leads to higher-than-necessary oscillations.

4. **Switching Off Engines**: Efficiently switching off engines when in a stable descent state helps in conserving fuel and minimizing points loss due to unnecessary thrust.

Refactoring the code, keeping key observations in focus:

Razonamiento:
Upon examining the best-performing code and its respective logs, it is notable this code strikes a balance while handling vertical descent, maintaining stable angles, and managing velocities. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of what improvements need to encapsulate an effective strategy:

### Observations from Best-Performing Code:
1. **Vertical Descent Control**: Uses upward thrust judiciously to manage descent velocity within a safe range.
2. **Angle and Angular Velocity Management**: Adjusts angle and angular velocity delicately, avoiding overcorrection to maintain stability.
3. **Horizontal Velocity Control**: Gradual adjustments ensure stability and prevent sudden changes in horizontal trajectory.
4. **Hierarchical Action Structure**: The sequential action prioritizes vertical control, angle adjustments, followed by horizontal velocity and angular velocity.

### Step-by-Step Strategy to Improve Results:
1. **Vertically Prioritize Safety**: Focus thrusts on achieving safe descent initially to stabilize landing trajectory, proportional to immediate descent needs.
2. **Mor Detailed Angular Corrections**: Introduce cross-checks to avoid abrupt angle shifts applying smaller corrections, managing imperceptible deviations ensuring gradual stabilization.
3. **Smooth Horizontal Adjustments**: Adjust horizontal velocities without compromising overall trajectory by applying minimal, timely side-thrust corrections.
4. **Integrated Checks**: Holistically manage engine thrust sequences enabling combined adjustments within singular cycles prioritized by current status requirements.

### Enhanced Implementation:
Refine the balancing sequence and integrations ensuring controlled, smooth descent and immediate corrective cross-checks engages optimal parachute/landing integrity.

### Detailed Analysis and Substantive Improvement Steps

#### Analysis of the Differences:

1. **Consistency in Thrust Application:** The best code shows a better balance in actions, including consistent use of the left and right engines to correct angles and velocities, while my code overcorrected and led to rapid velocity changes.

2. **Balanced Comprehensive Approach:** The best code adjusts vertical, horizontal, angular velocities, and angles in a synchronized manner, limiting overcorrection while maintaining stability.

3. **Judicious Inactive States:** The best implementation maintains more controlled inaction states, reducing unnecessary thrust thereby stabilizing the descent efficiently.

#### Steps to Improve:
1. **Controlled Angle and Thrust Corrections:** Consistently fine-tune angular adjustments and limit thrust overcorrections.
2. **Efficient Descent Velocity Management:** Focus on reducing descent velocity early and consistently to maintain stability.
3. **Balanced Transition States:** Integrate smaller adjustments to avoid drastic jumps in state variations, causing instability.

### Improved Code Implementation
Incorporate learned lessons to achieve a more controlled, balanced approach, effectively managing everything from angular corrections to horizontal velocity in a dynamic manner.

```python
import numpy as np

def act(observation):
    x_pos, y_pos, x_vel, y_vel, angle, ang_vel, left_contact, right_contact = observation

    # Constants for thresholds and actions
    MIN_ANGLE = -0.1
    MAX_ANGLE = 0.1
    SAFE_Y_VELOCITY = -0.5
    SAFE_X_VELOCITY = 0.1
    MAX_X_VELOCITY = 0.03
    MAX_ANGULAR_VELOCITY = 0.1

    # Successful landing conditions
    if left_contact == 1 and right_contact == 1:
        return 0  # The spacecraft has landed

    # Control vertical descent
    if y_vel < SAFE_Y_VELOCITY:
        return 2  # Apply upward thrust to control descent speed

    # Control angle corrections gradually
    if abs(angle) > MAX_ANGLE:
        if angle > 0:
            return 3  # Thrust right engine to correct to the left
        else:
            return 1  # Thrust left engine to correct to the right

    # Control horizontal velocity gradually
    if abs(x_vel) > SAFE_X_VELOCITY:
        if x_vel > 0:
            return 1  # Apply thrust to the left engine to reduce positive X velocity
        else:
            return 3  # Apply thrust to the right engine to reduce negative X velocity

    # Control angular velocity gently
    if abs(ang_vel) > MAX_ANGULAR_VELOCITY:
        if ang_vel > 0:
            return 1  # Apply thrust to the left engine to counter the right spin
        else:
            return 3  # Apply thrust to the right engine to counter the left spin

    # Default is to switch off engines when everything else is stable
    return 0
```

Razonamiento:
The performance logs show that the current strategy manages to land the spacecraft successfully by gradually controlling velocities and angles. However, several key insights indicate further improvements:

1. **Gradual Corrective Actions**: The incremental adjustments in both horizontal and vertical velocities work effectively, indicating a priority on smaller, consistent corrections.
2. **Focus on Angular Stability**: The logs emphasize gradual angle corrections, suggesting ongoing angle monitoring and correction prevent over-tilting and instability.
3. **Efficient Engine Usage**: The usage of the engines only when necessary highlights efficient fuel management, critical for maintaining higher scores.
4. **Noticing Performance Fluctuations**: Minor score losses occur due to delayed reactions or excessive corrections, indicating a more refined threshold or prioritization iteration could be beneficial.

By integrating these insights, the new approach can include the following enhancements:

- **Refined Control Thresholds**: Fine-tune thresholds for angle and velocities to prioritize more urgent corrections first.
- **Enhanced Correction Strategy**: Focus on balancing corrections for X and Y velocities while ensuring angle adjustments are smooth and reactive.
- **Fuel Conservation**: Ensure engines are frequently turned off once corrections are effectively applied to maintain higher scores.

Updated code reflecting these principles is:

Analyze the performance of the spacecraft and how it differs from the desired result. Be guided by the scoring system. Identify the cause of errors in your code and modify it without fear of making major changes. Think deeply about the priorities of your code and how to order and combine them correctly to achieve success. Remember that the code is a reflection of your reasoning and the way you approach the problem.

Razonamiento:
To understand and improve the landing process, we should break down the influence of the given actions ('0': Switch off engines, '1': Push left engine, '2': Push both engines (upwards), '3': Push right engine) on the spacecraft's state observations (X position, Y position, X velocity, Y velocity, Angle, Angular velocity, Left contact sensor, Right contact sensor).

Analyzing parameters:
1. X position: The horizontal position relative to the landing zone. Initially, the changes in X position with time determine if we're moving horizontally.
2. Y position: The vertical position relative to the landing zone. We need this to steadily decrease to reach the ground without steep dips, to not crash.
3. X velocity: The horizontal velocity. We aim to minimize this near zero upon landing to avoid horizontal impact.
4. Y velocity: The vertical velocity. We aim to minimize this near zero upon landing to avoid a hard land.
5. Angle: Orientation of the craft. We aim for the craft to be upright (angle close to zero) at ground contact.
6. Angular velocity: Speed of rotational change. Low values near zero on landing ensure the craft is stable.
7 and 8. Contact sensors should be 1 to reflect actual ground contact simultaneously (not tilting).

Each action impacts: Action 0 (no engines): Craft descends naturally due to gravity. No corrective forces.
- Action 1 (left engine): Reduces angle to left; counteracts right drift by rotating counterclockwise.
- Action 2 (center ‚Äì both engines): Arrests descent; minimises both X & Y velocities, keeps upright.
- Action 3 (right engine): Reduces angle to right; counteracts left drift by rotating clockwise.

Steps for safe & sound landing:
1. Minimise X velocity to follow the vertical alignment with the landing zone.
2. Maintain Y velocity safely low for a smooth descent.
3. Control any notable angular deviations to keep the spacecraft upright.
4. Use a combination of actions, balancing their costs with effective movement/stability corrections.
5. Aim for synchronized touchdown of left & right sensors indicating the craft isn‚Äôt tilted excessively.

The code logic to implement from these insights involves consistently assessing status post actions and making grounded corrections. Hence we favor the current status features close to target values (low velocities/angle); influence action choices optimized for achieving stable/corrected movements sequentially: Correct X velocity and keeping the craft upright and gentle descent.

Let's write the function implementing these reasoning steps.

Analyze the performance of the spacecraft and how it differs from the desired result. Be guided by the scoring system. Identify the cause of errors in your code and modify it without fear of making major changes. Think deeply about the priorities of your code and how to order and combine them correctly to achieve success. Remember that the code is a reflection of your reasoning and the way you approach the problem.

Razonamiento:
To achieve a successful landing, we need to consider the following essential aspects derived from the provided logs and schema: 1. **X and Y Positions**: We need to keep the spacecraft close to the target X position (0) and descend gradually in Y. 2. **X and Y Velocities**: The spacecraft's velocity must be minimized, especially near landing. Both X and Y velocities should be close to 0. Fast descent or horizontal movement can lead to crashes. 3. **Angle and Angular Velocity**: The spacecraft should be as vertical as possible (angle near 0). Angular velocity should also be minimized. 4. **Engine Actions**:  Switching off engines (0), pushing left engine (1), pushing both engines (upwards) (2), and pushing right engine (3). Each action affects the position, velocity, and angle. 5. **Score and Fuel**: Remember that firing side engines and the center engine impacts the score negatively (0.03 and 0.3 per frame). Conservative engine use is beneficial. Start by analyzing the key turning points in the logs and decision points leading to crashes or successful landings. Then translate this understanding into coding logic. For successful landing, prioritize minimizing the velocities and angle, making careful decisions to adjust X position using side and center engines only when necessary. Finally, I will use an algorithm referencing the existing logs to make decisions based on current observation states to maximize the score and achieve a safe landing.

Razonamiento:
Analyzing the logs provided, we can see that a successful landing involves managing the spacecraft's position, velocity, and angle meticulously. The key elements to monitor are:
 1. **X position (obs[0]) and Y position (obs[1]):** The horizontal and vertical positions relative to the landing zone. Ideally closer to 0 as the landing target is at (0,0).
 2. **X velocity (obs[2]) and Y velocity (obs[3]):** Horizontal and vertical velocities. Lower values are better for a successful landing. We need to ensure these are minimally after a slow descent.
 3. **Angle (obs[4]):** The spacecraft's tilt angle. The closer to 0, the better.
 4. **Angular velocity (obs[5]):** Rate of change of the angle. Should be minimal near landing.
 5. **Left contact sensor (obs[6]) and Right contact sensor (obs[7]):** These should ideally both be 1 once the spacecraft lands.

Actions:
 1. **Switch off engines (action 0):** Ceases all thrust.
 2. **Push left engine (action 1):** Momentarily increases thrust on the left side, causing a tilt to the right and a minor push to the left.
 3. **Push both engines (upwards) (action 2):** Provides an upward thrust, reducing vertical velocity and stabilizing the descent.
 4. **Push right engine (action 3):** Momentarily increases thrust on the right side, causing a tilt to the left and a minor push to the right.

From the successful and unsuccessful landings, it's clear that using both engines (action 2) to manage vertical velocity and occasional tilting with actions 1 and 3 for horizontal position and angle corrections is key.

**Steps to achieve a successful landing: **
1. **Orient spacecraft upright (angle ~ 0) and minimize angular velocity (obs[4] and obs[5]).**
2. **Reduce horizontal drift (obs[0] and obs[2]) using left and right thrusters (actions 3 and 1).**
3. **Control descent speed (obs[3]) by using the upward thrust (action 2) to ensure a safe landing speed.**
4. **Monitor position and make fine adjustments using actions 1 and 3 if drift occurs.**
5. **Switch off engines (action 0) in final moments if all parameters are within safe landing thresholds.**

Implementing the above reasoning, we adjust the act() function to make it more decision-based and less random.

Razonamiento:
To achieve a successful landing, the spacecraft must meet specific conditions: it must land within the designated zone (X position close to 0), have minimal velocity both horizontally and vertically, remain nearly vertical, and ideally touch down with both legs. The scoring system emphasizes these factors, penalizing excessive speed, angles, and engine usage. Analyzing past logs and understanding state dynamics are crucial for tweaking the function to make better decisions. Each observation parameter indicates the state of the spacecraft relative to the landing conditions. Here‚Äôs an analysis of each parameter:

X Position: The horizontal distance of the spacecraft from the landing area. Ideally, this should approach 0.
Y Position: The altitude of the spacecraft. During landing, this should decrease smoothly to 0.
X Velocity: The horizontal speed at which the spacecraft is moving. A lower magnitude is better.
Y Velocity: The vertical speed at which the spacecraft is moving. A lower magnitude is better.
Angle: The tilt of the spacecraft. It should be close to 0 for a vertical landing.
Angular Velocity: The rate of change of the angle. This should also be close to 0 for stability.
Left contact sensor: Whether the left leg is touching the ground.
Right contact sensor: Whether the right leg is touching the ground.

Actions:
0: Switch off engines. This will let the spacecraft fall due to gravity.
1: Push left engine. This causes a rightward force and clockwise rotation.
2: Push both engines (upwards). This counteracts gravity and reduces descent speed.
3: Push right engine. This causes a leftward force and counterclockwise rotation.

To achieve a successful landing, the agent should balance between pushing engines to slow descent and correcting angles, without excessively using fuel (which affects the score). Key steps include:

Monitoring X Position and X Velocity to keep horizontal drift minimal.
Reducing Y Velocity progressively to avoid hard landings.
Correcting the Angle using left or right engines to maintain vertical orientation.
Switching off engines at appropriate times to conserve fuel while allowing for controlled descent.
Touching down with minimal velocity and with both contact sensors engaging the landing zone.

By learning when to push, when to switch off, and how to balance the horizontal and vertical speeds while maintaining a stable orientation, the spacecraft can land successfully with a high score.

Razonamiento:
The major issues with the initial code were overcorrecting attitudes and velocities, using side engines excessively, leading to high angular velocities, and not handling the vertical descent effectively. The best-coded attempts focused on maintaining stable angles and proper velocity thresholds for safe landing.

To address these issues, we can follow these steps:
1. **Minimize Excessive Corrections**: Steer clear of fast and hasty switching of side engines; smooth transition using conditions on hour velocity changes. Avoid abrupt actions on minor deviations.
2. **Stabilize Descent**: Use the upward engine to stabilize the vertical descent and slow the craft effectively without rapid velocity changes.
3. **Fine Tune for Thresholds**: Check and adjust acceptable tolerances for angle and velocity as thresholds to make gentle corrections. Don't activate side engines impulsively.
4. **Prioritize Upright Descent**: Ensure the craft's orientation remains aligned, prioritizing reduced tilt permissible ranges by an error overlap.
5. **Avoid Angular Oscillations**: Use tighter controls from angular velocities below thresholds to steer finely.

Let's write the updated function implementing these steps.

Razonamiento:
To achieve better results, I'll focus on a few key improvements: 1. Analyze the movement and control: avoid excessive usage of side engines that cause rapid tilts and angular velocities. 2. Optimize vertical speed control: engage vertical thrusters only when necessary to slow descent. 3. Maintain stability and minimize drift: adjust horizontal movement gradually. Finally, I'll ensure gentle corrections when using side thrusters and make careful use of vertical thrust to avoid overshooting desired states.

Razonamiento:
Analyzing the logs from the recent landing attempt, it is evident that the spacecraft is struggling to maintain stability and control its descent speed effectively. Specific observations:
1. **Consistent usage of left and right engines (actions 1 and 3)** caused a continuous increase in the spacecraft's horizontal velocity, leading to higher instability.
2. **Lack of sufficient upward thrust (action 2)** to counteract the descending speed, especially as the spacecraft gets closer to the ground.
3. **Angular handling** was partially efficient but not well-tuned to prioritize stabilizing the descent.

To improve the approach, we need:
1. More focused control on the vertical descent speed by using the upward thrust (action 2) more frequently and effectively.
2. Fine adjustments for horizontal velocity using left and right engines when excess drift is detected (beyond a wider tolerance).
3. Continuous monitoring and correction of the angle to ensure the spacecraft descends in a stable, upright position, especially when it nears the ground.

Combining all the observations, a revised act() function should involve more balance between upward thrust and minor horizontal and angular adjustments. This new approach will focus on prioritizing vertical descent control while stabilizing horizontal movement and angle as secondary tasks.

Razonamiento:
Examining the performance of the previous successful log (-141.601) and the failed attempt (-556.651), we can immediately identify several areas for improvement. The main issues that led to the crash include uncontrolled angular velocity, excessive horizontal and vertical speeds, and mismanagement of the spacecraft's angle.

To address these issues, I will follow these steps to ensure better control of the spacecraft:
1. Maintain a near-vertical angle since a tilted spacecraft would create issues on landing.
2. Continuously monitor and control the horizontal and vertical speeds to prevent crashing due to excessive speed.
3. Optimize fuel usage by making necessary thrust adjustments and switching off the engines when appropriate.
4. Ensure gradual descent by reducing both horizontal and vertical velocities.
5. Stabilize the spacecraft's tilt using side engines as soon as it deviates sufficiently from the vertical position.

Here‚Äôs the updated code to reflect the above reasoning:

Razonamiento:
The best results are achieved by maintaining stability and avoiding excessive corrections. In particular, the code attempting score of -118.51 utilized effective control parameters and avoided abrupt changes. Let's incorporate these learnings and further refine the actuator logic to ensure the spacecraft maintains its horizontal and vertical orientation steadily while controlling the tilt safely. Key parameters considered are angles and velocities for precise correction and prevention of abrupt actions. We'll also consider smoother transitions to stabilize the vertical descent effectively.

Improvements to be made include:
- Fine-tuning threshold values for angle, angular velocity, and drift velocities.
- Introducing a gradual reduction in engine usage for smoother stabilization.
- Better organization and prioritization of control mechanisms for angle adjustments before drift corrections.

Razonamiento:
The results show the spacecraft failing to maintain controlled descent and tilting too much. Observations from successful attempts indicate the importance of stabilizing the angle and controlling descent speed carefully. The previous approach aimed to correct horizontal drift and vertical speed but fell short due to over-adjustments in tilting and delayed responses in vertical speed correction. Adjustments will be made to prioritize vertical speed correction early, angle stabilization, gradual horizontal drift correction, and minimalistic use of side engines.

Razonamiento:
The performance of the spacecraft has shown consistent issues with controlling horizontal motion and angular velocity, which leads to instability and eventual crashes. The key issues observed include:
1. **Overuse of side engines (actions 1 and 3):** This leads to excessive horizontal velocity and angular velocity, making it difficult to stabilize the spacecraft.
2. **Inadequate use of the upward thruster (action 2):** There is insufficient control over the vertical descent speed.
3. **Inconsistent angle corrections:** The logic is not effectively correcting the tilt and maintaining the vertical orientation.

To address these issues, we need to introduce a more balanced approach to manage the spacecraft's vertical descent speed while minimizing horizontal drift and maintaining a stable angle. The strategy should focus primarily on achieving a safe vertical descent speed, and maintaining a stable and upright orientation with minimal tilt. Horizontal corrections should be secondary and only applied when necessary.

Improvements include:
1. Prioritizing the use of the upward thrust to control vertical speed.
2. Using minimal side thrusts to maintain horizontal stability. 
3. Ensuring consistent corrections to the spacecraft's angle to keep it upright.
4. Introducing guard clauses to prevent overuse of any single engine.

Implementing these strategies, the updated act() function should involve careful alignment of all these priorities in a stepwise manner.

Analyze the performance of the spacecraft and how it differs from the desired result. Be guided by the scoring system. Identify the cause of errors in your code and modify it without fear of making major changes. Think deeply about the priorities of your code and how to order and combine them correctly to achieve success. Remember that the code is a reflection of your reasoning and the way you approach the problem.

Razonamiento:
After analyzing the most successful run with a score of -118.51, it's clear that this approach effectively manages the spacecraft's stability, horizontal drift, and descent rate better than my earlier attempts. The primary areas to focus improvements are on preventing excessive wobble (angular velocity) and ensuring that the engines are used effectively to maintain vertical speed within safe limits. Consistently managing the factors related to angle and angular velocity is crucial for a successful landing. The following code makes adjustments to better balance all these dynamics, aiming to refine the act function step-by-step for improved performance.

Steps to improve:
1. Ensure sharper corrections for angle and angular velocity deviations.
2. Maintain more conservative thresholds to trigger corrective actions early.
3. Prioritize reducing descent speed before focusing on reducing horizontal speeds if the vertical speed is high.
4. Minimize fuel usage by executing only necessary actions.
5. Adjust ranges of considered safe values and actions to be more pragmatic.
6. Different task-specific priorities (e.g., fixing angle before velocity) based on the score impact and past analysis.
7. Use upward engines gradually to maintain descending within the desired range.

The following code reflects these refinements:

Analyze the performance of the spacecraft and how it differs from the desired result. Be guided by the scoring system. Identify the cause of errors in your code and modify it without fear of making major changes. Think deeply about the priorities of your code and how to order and combine them correctly to achieve success. Remember that the code is a reflection of your reasoning and the way you approach the problem.

Razonamiento:
The highest scoring strategy effectively balances the spacecraft's movements to reduce velocity and maintain stability before landing. From our analysis, the main conclusions are:

1. **Angle and Angular Velocity Correction**: Stabilizing the craft's orientation is crucial before improving its velocity. The successful code checks these parameters before addressing horizontal or vertical drift.
2. **Conservative Vertical Speed Control**: Using the main (both) engines to manage descent gently and gradually, while only correcting the side tilt when absolutely necessary, to avoid any sharp descents or crashes.
3. **Priority Adjustments**: Handling angular stability and slower descent first before adjusting horizontal movements led to higher scores.
4. **Conservative Engine Actions**: Minimizing engine usage when stability is nearly achieved (i.e., turning off engines periodically to save score points) or maintaining minor corrections (to avoid score drops due to engine overuse).
5. **Simpler Control Logic**: A straightforward, consistent approach to small corrections results in better overall control.

With these insights, the updated function will include the conservative engine adjustments, prioritization logic, and specific control thresholds within reasonable safe ranges.

Let's rewrite the updated function meticulously.

Analyze the performance of the spacecraft and how it differs from the desired result. Be guided by the scoring system. Identify the cause of errors in your code and modify it without fear of making major changes. Think deeply about the priorities of your code and how to order and combine them correctly to achieve success. Remember that the code is a reflection of your reasoning and the way you approach the problem.

Razonamiento:
To improve the existing code and achieve better results, analyze the key aspects of the best result logs: 1. Correction of orientation and stabilization of angular velocity to keep the spacecraft upright. 2. Effective management of vertical speed to control descent rate. 3. Controlled horizontal drift correction when necessary to keep the spacecraft centered. The goal is to keep actions balanced and minimal to avoid dramatic changes while ensuring adherence to safe thresholds. The code will incorporate these points and adjust action logic based on the latest logs.

Analyze the performance of the spacecraft and how it differs from the desired result. Be guided by the scoring system. Identify the cause of errors in your code and modify it without fear of making major changes. Think deeply about the priorities of your code and how to order and combine them correctly to achieve success. Remember that the code is a reflection of your reasoning and the way you approach the problem.

Razonamiento:
The landing was closer to success compared to the previous attempts, but it still failed to achieve a score of 200 points. The issues observed are as follows:

1. **Vertical Speed Not Controlled Efficiently:** There was a failure to adequately slow the descent using the upward thruster. The spacecraft often hovered or over-corrected, leading to inefficiencies and negative scores.
2. **Excessive Use of Side Thrusters:** The frequent switching between left and right engines caused instability and made it difficult to maintain a steady descent and position.
3. **Persistent Angular Velocities:** While some angular corrections were made, they were not consistent enough to stabilize the spacecraft fully throughout the descent.

Improvements should include a more conservative approach to using thrusters and better handling of angular stabilization. The primary focus must be consistently reducing vertical speed while making minimal and precise corrections to horizontal velocity and angle. Furthermore, better prioritization and coordination of actions can help maintain stability.

**Modified Strategy**:
1. **Use upward thrust consistently to manage vertical speed.** Avoid overuse; only apply it when necessary to ensure controlled descent speed below a threshold.
2. **Minimal corrections with side thrusters only when horizontal drift exceeds a certain range or angle deviations are significant.**
3. **Monitor and correct angular velocity as a secondary priority but maintain focus on stabilizing within safe ranges.**
4. **Fine-tune the firing of engines to achieve a smoother descent and avoid unnecessary oscillations.**

Here's the updated approach in the `act` function:

Razonamiento:
The recent log with a score of 192.155 achieved a successful controlled landing by emphasizing the actions required to manage both vertical speed and angle deviations, and judiciously using propulsion while initiating corrective actions. The code snippet manages to slow descent using both engines, correct horizontal drift only when the spacecraft is stable (both angle and angular velocity under control), and keeps fuel usage minimal.

From comparing the successful log against the previous attempts, the key improvements to emphasize are:
1. Prioritize managing the angle and angular velocity to remain nearly upright throughout descent.
2. Use vertical propulsion to control descent speed before addressing lateral drift, ensuring a smoother landing.
3. Introduce refined ranges for what's considered 'safe' in terms of speed, descent, and angular dynamics.
4. Manage transitions smoothly by keeping consistent checks across all conditions.

To further refine, further incremental adjustments for these safe ranges could enhance outputs by optimizing dynamic control. Here‚Äôs an updated version following these detailed strategic observations:

Razonamiento:
Analyzing the history and the most successful code, a few key points stand out: The most successful strategy focuses on maintaining stable descent through minor, accurate corrections in tilt and velocity. Priority is given to stabilizing angles and velocities before horizontal movements. Conservation of fuel is achieved by frequent engine shutoffs when not necessary.

Key areas of improvement:
1. **Frequent Engine Use Corrections**: Correct tilts and angular velocities proportionally. Thus keeping the engines off increases the score resulting in smoother and efficient descent.
2. **Prioritize Vertical Control**: Ensure the spacecraft predominantly maintains safe vertical speed and reduces horizontal drift consequently.
3. **Enhanced Angle Corrections**: Perform slight tilts using side engines to stabilize orientations before managing vertical speed.
4. **Economize Fuel**: Turn off engines when close to the target velocities to minimize score penalties.

Implementing these insights step by step in the function for improved performance:
1. Use constants to define acceptable limits for angle, vertical, and horizontal velocities.
2. Validate contact points to confirm safe landing.
3. Correct orientation logically with proportional adjustments till angle and velocity before applying horizontal corrections under a stable state.
4. Emphasize turning off engines conservatively when values align within acceptable safety ranges.

Razonamiento:
The latest code has shown significant improvement in performance, achieving a successful landing. However, there are still some areas for further refinement: 1. Maintain gradual corrections using side engines to avoid oscillations. 2. Optimize the timing of vertical thrust to ensure smoother descent control without excessive fuel usage. 3. Ensure balance between actions when the spacecraft is close to the landing site to avoid overshooting or drifting. By focusing on these areas, the code can be further optimized.

Razonamiento:
By comparing the previous highest scoring log and your recent attempt, several patterns and differences can be observed that influence the final scores:
1. **Effective Management of Vertical Speed:** Ensuring that the vertical descent speed is controlled effectively for most parts of the descent, but minimal corrections were required as descent speed was generally within a reasonable range.
2. **Minimal Side Thrust Usage:** Limiting the use of the side thrusters. Over the course of both landing attempts, excessive side thruster usage seems detrimental, causing instability and oscillation in the horizontal velocities and angles. The highest scoring attempt shows fewer side thruster actions (actions 1 and 3), indicating better stability management.
3. **Consistent Vertical Thrust Use:** Frequent and consistent use of the central thruster (action 2) to maintain vertical descent speed and stabilize overall descent angle and velocity.
4. **Correct Prioritization:** Incorporating corrections to angle and vertical speed first before horizontal adjustments or other fine-tuning actions.
5. **Avoiding Over-Correction:** Judicious use of thrusters to avoid oscillating or over-correcting, leading to smoother control and better final score calculation.
To improve results further, a stepwise, conservative approach to script modification involves better prioritization (vertical speed and angle stabilization over all else), reduction in oscillation/noise by limiting ineffective action sequences, and ensuring consistent use of the vertical thrust when needed.
Here's the revised and improved code:

Analyze the performance of the spacecraft and how it differs from the desired result. Be guided by the scoring system. Identify the cause of errors in your code and modify it without fear of making major changes. Think deeply about the priorities of your code and how to order and combine them correctly to achieve success. Remember that the code is a reflection of your reasoning and the way you approach the problem.

Razonamiento:
Based on the past analysis and comparison, it's evident that ensuring safe and controlled landing conditions through a robust and specific action plan is essential. The best result of a score of 206.036 achieved stable vertical and horizontal speeds while managing the angle and angular velocity efficiently. Key observations for improvement include consistently correcting tilts, managing angular velocity, controlling vertical speeds, and addressing drift only when the spacecraft is stable. The successful log indicates that frequent small adjustments help maintain control without excessive fuel use. We will incorporate more precisely refined thresholds and enhanced checks for fine-tuning actions.

Here‚Äôs a refined and step-by-step updated code incorporating these insights:
