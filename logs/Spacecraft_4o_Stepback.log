2024-07-01 20:48:27,872 - INFO - To maximize the score and achieve a successful landing, a thorough understanding of how each action affects the spacecraft's state and score is crucial. The key observations and their values play significant roles in deciding the next action. Here are the detailed thoughts and steps considering each state parameter and examining the effects of the actions:

### Analysis of Observations

1. **Position (X, Y)**:
    - X position: Horizontal position relative to the landing zone.
    - Y position: Vertical position above the landing zone.

2. **Velocity (X velocity, Y velocity)**:
    - X velocity: Horizontal speed. Should ideally be minimized to avoid lateral movements.
    - Y velocity: Vertical speed. Should be reduced gradually for a soft landing.

3. **Angle**:
    - The tilt angle relative to the vertical line. For a successful landing, this should be kept close to zero.

4. **Angular Velocity**:
    - The rate of change of the tilt angle. Ideally, this should also be minimized.

5. **Contact Sensors (Left, Right)**:
    - Indicate whether left or right sides are in contact with the landing zone. A successful touchdown typically requires both sensors to be engaged simultaneously with minimal velocities and tilt.

### Effect of Actions

1. **Action 0: Switch off engines**
    - No change in position directly. Gravity will induce a negative velocity in Y (falling).
    - No angular change induced, but pre-existing angular velocities persist.
    - Reduces fuel usage; no immediate lateral or vertical thrust applied.

2. **Action 1: Push left engine**
    - Produces thrust on the right side causing counter-clockwise rotation. Can be used to reduce positive angles or increase negative angles.
    - Induces a horizontal movement to the right while providing a slight upward thrust.

3. **Action 2: Push both engines (upwards)**
    - Provides a uniform vertical thrust that opposes gravity.
    - Reduces Y velocity (deceleration in descent), crucial for soft landing.
    - Consumes significant fuel and should be used judiciously.

4. **Action 3: Push right engine**
    - Produces thrust on the left side causing clockwise rotation. Can be used to reduce negative angles or increase positive angles.
    - Induces a horizontal movement to the left while providing a slight upward thrust.

### Strategy for Successful Landing

To achieve a successful landing, the following must be managed simultaneously:
1. **Maintain or Reduce Horizontal Velocity (X velocity)**
    - Actions 1 and 3 can be used to correct horizontal drift to ideally zero.
    - A balance between these actions depends on the current horizontal position (X).

2. **Controlled Descent (Y velocity)**
    - Use Action 2 (push both engines) to reduce descent speed when Y velocity is too high.
    - Avoid abrupt changes; gradual reductions are preferred.

3. **Minimize Angle and Angular Velocity**
    - Actions 1 and 3 must be employed to correct angular deviations.
    - Keeping the spacecraft near 0 degrees and minimizing angular velocity to stabilize the craft's orientation.

4. **Final Approach**
    - As the spacecraft nears the landing zone with minimal Y velocity, both engines should be used minimally to ensure a smooth touch.
    - Ensure minimal horizontal speed and slight corrections with Actions 1 and 3 to align perfectly above the landing zone.

5. **Touchdown**
    - Engage both engines sparingly to counter gravity as the descent velocity becomes minimal.
    - Ideally, at the exact moment of landing, the velocities (both X and Y) should be close to zero with the angle mostly neutral.

### Practical Implementation Steps

1. **Initial Descent Phase:**
    - Control the horizontal drift by using regular bursts of Actions 1 or 3.
    - Monitor and adjust Y velocity using Action 2 judiciously.

2. **Mid-Descent:**
    - Continue refining the tilt and angular velocity.
    - Reduce Y velocity progressively using balanced thrust to prepare for the landing.

3. **Approaching Landing Zone:**
    - Make finer adjustments to ensure minimal horizontal speed.
    - Keep the Y velocity low and the angle close to neutral.

4. **Touchdown:**
    - Ensure both contact sensors engage at low speeds and minimal angles by using combined gentle thrusts of Action 2 with minimal lateral corrections.

### In Summary
- **Minimize Side Movements:** Regularly use Actions 1 and 3 to neutralize any horizontal drifts.
- **Manage Descent Rate:** Use Action 2 to decelerate and keep a controlled vertical fall.
- **Stabilize Orientation:** Correct angles continuously with Actions 1 and 3 as needed.
- **Final Soft Touchdown:** Ensure the craft's speed (both X and Y) and angle are near zero for a successful landing.

By following these systematic steps, achieving a score exceeding 200 points and ensuring successful landings is possible.

2024-07-01 20:52:17,731 - INFO - To achieve a successful landing, it is essential to understand and control not only the spacecraft's position and velocity but also its angular dynamics. Here's a detailed breakdown of the key elements in the observations and necessary actions:

### Key Observations and Actions

1. **Position (X, Y)**:
   - **X position**: Horizontal distance from the landing zone center.
   - **Y position**: Height above the landing area.

2. **Velocity (X velocity, Y velocity)**:
   - **X velocity**: Speed in the horizontal direction. It should ideally be close to zero to avoid horizontal skidding at landing.
   - **Y velocity**: Speed in the vertical direction. This also should be slow to ensure a gentle touchdown.

3. **Angle and Angular Velocity**:
   - **Angle**: The tilt of the spacecraft. Perfect vertical alignment is zero degrees. Any deviation should be corrected to avoid landing on an edge.
   - **Angular velocity**: The rate at which the angle is changing. This should be controlled to stabilize the spacecraft.

4. **Contact Sensors (Left, Right)**:
   - Indicators of whether the left or right side of the spacecraft is touching the landing area. A successful landing occurs when both sensors are activated at the same time.

### Scoring System
- **Proximity to Landing Area**: The closer the X and Y positions are to zero, the higher the score.
- **Velocity**: Lower velocities yield higher scores.
- **Tilt**: Less tilt means higher scores.
- **Engine Usage**: Using side engines (actions 1 and 3) decreases score slightly (-0.03), while the main engine (action 2) decreases score more significantly (-0.3).
- **Landing**: 100 points are added for a successful landing, and lost for a crash.

### Required Strategy for Successful Landing
#### General Approach
- **Stabilize Horizontal Position and Velocity**:
  - Use side engines strategically to correct and minimize horizontal velocity and position. You should not oscillate heavily left and right.
  
- **Control Vertical Descent**:
  - Use the main engine intermittently to slow descent. Avoid sustained main engine burns that can oscillate the velocity sharply.

- **Maintain Upright Orientation**:
  - Correct any tilt using appropriate side engines. This needs to maintain a fine balance to avoid over-correction, ideally keeping the angle near zero.

#### Step-by-Step Guide
1. **Initial Stabilization**:
   - Begin by observing the initial states of position, velocity, and angle. Immediate corrective action should be focused on reducing extreme velocities or angles using side engines.
   - Example: If X velocity is high, use action 1 or 3 (side engines) to gradually reduce it.

2. **Control Descent Rate**: 
   - Use the main engine sporadically (action 2) to manage the descent rate. Ensure Y velocity remains in a controllable range and not too high.
   - Check angles and apply small corrections with side engines to stabilize.

3. **Fine Adjustments**:
   - As the spacecraft gets closer to the landing zone (lower Y position), fine-tune the velocities and angles to be as close to zero as possible.
   - Switch off engines (action 0) strategically when aligned correctly and at a proper descent rate to conserve score.

4. **Final Approach**:
   - Ensure both horizontal and vertical velocities are minimal and angle is near zero.
   - Adjust using minimal side engine bursts if needed to correct any minor drift or tilt right before landing.

5. **Touchdown**:
   - Ideally, both sensors should activate within a frame or two of each other, indicating a flat, stable landing.
   - Monitor sensors to verify both have registered contact for a successful landing.

#### Considerations from Logs
- Excessive use of engines (especially the main engine) should be avoided due to significant scoring penalties.
- Oscillations in actions (repeated switching between engines) should be minimized as they often cause instability and faster score decline.

By following these strategies, fine-tuning actions based on real-time observations, and making minimal, precise movements, a successful landing with a score exceeding 200 is achievable.

Smaller values (close to zero) are better.\n2. **Y Position (obs[1])**: The vertical position of the spacecraft relative to the landing zone. The objective is to minimize this as the spacecraft descends to the landing pad.\n3. **X Velocity (obs[2])**: The horizontal speed. Should be minimized to ensure a gentle landing.\n4. **Y Velocity (obs[3])**: The vertical speed. Should also be minimized to ensure a smoother landing.\n5. **Angle (obs[4])**: The spacecraftâs tilt. Should be close to zero to avoid tipping over.\n6. **Angular Velocity (obs[5])**: The rate of change of the angle.

It also creates a counter-clockwise torque, reducing the angle (tilting left).\n3. **Action 2 (Push both engines up)**: This reduces the downward velocity and can help to stabilize or slowly ascend.\n4. **Action 3 (Push right engine)**: This results in a thrust to the left. It creates a clockwise torque, increasing the angle (tilting right).\n\n#### Steps to Achieve a Successful Landing:\n1. **Stabilize the Spacecraft**:\n  - Prioritize reducing the angular velocity and bringing the angle to 0.\n  - Use action 1 if the angle is positive and action 3 if the angle is negative.\n2. **Reduce Horizontal Velocity**:\n  - Use action 1 if the X velocity is negative and action 3 if it is positive.\n3. **Prepare for Landing**:\n  - Use action 2 periodically to reduce the vertical velocity.\n  - Ensure that both X and Y velocities are minimal as the spacecraft approaches the ground.\n  - Avoid excessive use of side engines as they reduce the score significantly.\n', 'code': 'def act(observation):\n    x_pos, y_pos, x_vel, y_vel, angle, angular_vel, left_contact, right_contact = observation\n    \n    # Step 1: Stabilize the Spacecraft\n    if angular_vel < -0.5 or angle < -0.1:  # Rotating too fast left or tilted left\n        return 1\n    if angular_vel > 0.5 or angle > 0.1:  # Rotating too fast right or tilted right\n        return 3\n    \n    # Step 2: Reduce Horizontal Velocity\n    if x_vel < -0.5:  # Moving too fast to the left\n        return 3\n    if x_vel > 0.5:  # Moving too fast to the right\n        return 1\n    \n    # Step 3: Prepare for Landing (Control Vertical Velocity)\n    if y_vel < -0.5:  # Falling too fast\n        return 2\n\n    return 0', 'filename': 'Action.py'}

The code didn't manage to correct the trajectory effectively, leading to unnecessary extended periods of inaction and incorrect sequential thrust applications. Notably, the code failed to properly balance horizontal velocity, vertical descent rate, and spacecraft stabilization.\n\n### Problems Identified:\n1. **Extended Inaction**: No action was taken when corrections were evidently needed, leading to continuous increases in vertical and horizontal velocities.\n2. **Sequential Thrusts**: Excessive repeated side thrusts were applied without balancing or correcting the overall motion effectively.\n3. **Incorrect Prioritization**: Angular stabilization seemed to overshadow the need to manage descent rate and horizontal drift effectively.\n\n### Modifications Needed:\n1. **More Frequent Action Checks**: Adjust the timings and conditions to ensure actions are taken continuously rather than in set sequential frames based on previous state values.\n2. **Balance Thrusts**: Alternate between necessary stabilization, horizontal position corrections, and vertical descent rate management in a more balanced manner.\n3. **Prioritize Vertical Stabilization on Issue**: Ensure vertical velocity correction is frequent enough to prevent dangerous descent velocities from building up.\n\n### Updated Code\nThis revised approach addresses the issues by tighter integration of action conditions and combining corrections more dynamically and frequently based on the spacecraft's current state values.\n", 'code': 'def act(observation):\n    x_pos, y_pos, x_vel, y_vel, angle, angular_vel, left_contact, right_contact = observation\n\n    # More proactive stabilization\n    if angle < -0.1 or angular_vel < -0.5:\n        return 1\n    elif angle > 0.1 or angular_vel > 0.5:\n        return 3\n    \n    # More frequent horizontal control checks\n    if x_pos < -0.1 or x_vel < -0.5:\n        return 3\n    elif x_pos > 0.1 or x_vel > 0.5:\n        return 1\n\n    # Prioritize vertical stabilization\n    if y_vel < -0.2:\n        return 2\n\n    # Default action if conditions are met\n    return 0', 'filename': 'Action.py'}

The sequence of actions observed has shown prolonged execution of a single action type, leading to insufficient response to accumulated velocity, both horizontal and vertical. The spacecraftâs descent was not controlled properly, leading it to crash.\n\n### Identified issues\n1. **Prolonged Inaction**: Multiple consecutive steps executed no action, making the spaceship quickly deviate further from the desired descent path.\n2. **Insufficient Handling of Descent Speed**: Although vertical stabilization commands were triggered, they were neither appropriately timed nor frequent enough.\n3. **Over-corrective Angular Adjustments**: Excessive thrust applications in one direction without alternating or adjusting to the impact led to failure. This implies a lack of balancing immediate requirements across axes (vertical, horizontal, and angular).\n4. **Unbalanced Prioritization**: The overall priority system failed to consider the immediate needs in a controlled manner.\n\n### Solution Approach\n1. **Reduce Inaction Frames**: Ensure every frame delivers active state evaluation prompting regular necessary actions.\n2. **Combining Angular, Vertical and Horizontal Moves**: Integrate an evaluation loop within each action, ensuring increased balanced correction speed and fewer single-action locks based on the severity of deviation across observed states.\n3. **Immediate Angular Velocity and Descent Speed Management**: Focus on a more dynamic and adaptive priority system promptly adjusting based on the observed state shifts more accurately across all relevant vectors, balancing angular adjustments and descent speed.\n4. **Balanced Composite Actions**: Frame-wise frequent checks dynamically balancing angular rates, descent speed, and horizontal drift corrections contextually.\n\n### Revised Code\nThe revised code integrates continuous dynamic adjustments, ensuring greater active response to deviations in each axis, sharing actions more dynamically and balanced across necessary thrust promptings to maintain control and guided descent effectively.\n", 'code': 'def act(observation):\n    x_pos, y_pos, x_vel, y_vel, angle, angular_vel, left_contact, right_contact = observation\n\n    # Balance correction effectively for combined actions on vectors.\n    # Adjust angles first if significantly deviated:\n    if angle < -0.1 or angular_vel < -0.5:\n        return 1  # correct tilt left\n    elif angle > 0.1 or angular_vel > 0.5:\n        return 3  # correct tilt right\n\n    # Control horizontal position and velocity together\n    if x_pos < -0.1 or x_vel < -0.5:\n        return 3  # redirect right\n    elif x_pos > 0.1 or x_vel > 0.5:\n        return 1  # redirect left\n\n    # Control descent speed more actively\n    if y_vel < -0.2:\n        return 2  # Main engine burst to slow fast downward speed\n\n    # Default fallback ensuring balanced no-action if compounded vectors within allowed range\n    return 0', 'filename': 'Action.py'}

### Analysis of Successful Landing Log and Initial Logic

1. **Initial Conditions**:
    - The spacecraft is at a high altitude.
    - It has a slight horizontal and vertical velocity and a minor tilt.
2. **Actions**:
    - The sequence primarily uses actions 1, 2, and 3 (engine pushes in different directions).
    - In many instances, action 0 (engines off) is chosen strategically.
3. **Scoring**:
    - The score decreases with higher velocities and tilt angles; there's also a cost for firing engines.
    - Maintaining minimal horizontal and vertical velocities is crucial.
    - A balanced angle near to vertical (0 degrees relative angle) is necessary.
4. **Key Observations**:
    - X and Y velocities should be minimized before landing.
    - Angular velocity and angle need to be properly managed using side engines.
    - Keep the use of engines balanced to minimize score penalties.

### Strategy for Successful Landing

1. **Start Descent**: Use balanced engine thrust to control descent, ensuring that vertical velocity doesn't become too high.
2. **Minimize Horizontal Movement**: Use side engines to correct any horizontal drift. Aim to keep horizontal velocity close to zero.
3. **Correct Angle**: Use side engines to ensure the spacecraft is as close to vertical as possible before landing.
4. **Final Approach**: Ensure that vertical velocity is minimal, horizontal velocity is near zero, and the spacecraft is vertical.
5. **Touchdown**: Ensure contact sensors indicate a stable landing with no bouncing or sliding.

Based on the above analysis, the code will focus on balancing vertical and horizontal velocities while maintaining a near-vertical descent.

### Implementation

```python
import numpy as np

def act(observation):
    x_pos, y_pos, x_vel, y_vel, angle, ang_vel, left_contact, right_contact = observation
    action = 0  # Default action is to turn off all engines
    if y_vel < -0.2:  # Too fast horizontal
        action = 2 # Trigger both engines to slow down
        if x_vel > 0.3:  # Drifting to the right
            action = 1 # Correct drifting to the right using left engine
        elif x_vel < -0.3:  # Drifting to the left
            action = 3 # Correct drifting to the left using right engine
    elif abs(angle) > 0.5:  # Large angle deviation
        if angle > 0:
            action = 1 # Correct angle if tilted to the right
        else:
            action = 3 # Correct angle if tilted to the left
    elif y_vel < -1.0:  # Too fast vertical
        action = 2 # Trigger both engines to slow down
    return action
```
**Explanation**:
- If vertical velocity (`y_vel`) exceeds a safe threshold, it triggers both engines to reduce the speed.
- If horizontal velocity (`x_vel`) is significant, it uses side engines to correct the trajectory.
- It corrects large angle deviations using appropriate side engines.
- Prioritizes reducing vertical speed over correcting position.

This code uses a simple rule-based system to balance the spacecraftâs speed and position for a successful landing.

### Analysis of the Logs
**Performance Differences**:
1. **Initial Descent**:
    - The initial strategy of not using engines (`action = 0`) is ineffective. The spacecraft's velocity and position drift significantly before any corrective action is taken.
2. **Horizontal Velocity Management**:
    - The spacecraft has a persistent horizontal drift, leading to continual corrections without effectively slowing down horizontal speed. The code intermittently uses both engines to slow descent but does not consistently manage horizontal drift early enough.
    - Instead of reducing horizontal speed, the spacecraft drifts increasingly, causing frequent use of side engines, leading to increased costs and tilting problems.
3. **Vertical Velocity Management**:
    - The vertical speed is not adequately reduced, leading to hard impacts and subsequent crashes. This is exacerbated by the spacecraft drifting horizontally the entire time.
4. **Tilt and Angle Control**:
    - The angle control is insufficient, allowing significant tilt and high angular velocities to develop and persist. This causes further use of side engines, inducing penalties and instability.

### Logical Adjustments
- **Early Intervention**: Start controlling descent early, with gradual vertical speed reduction and drift correction before high speeds set in.
- **Prioritize Major Corrections**: Rotate to vertical quickly; manage angular velocity before reducing horizontal drift. Gradually correct horizontal speed while handling vertical descent continuously.
- **Angle Prioritization**: First, always correct angles to near zero before reducing speed so control can be more predictable.
- **Controlled Descent and Drift**: Alternate actions between reducing both vertical and horizontal velocities and balancing tilting.

### Implementation Strategy
1. Start descent with immediate engine use to slow vertical speed and correct drift.
2. Alternate between angle corrections and horizontal velocity corrections if vertical velocity is controlled.
3. Final descent control for reduced horizontal and vertical velocity, ensuring minimal tilt.
4. Prioritize consistent vertical speed reduction and drift balancing throughout descent.

Updated Code:
```python
import numpy as np

def act(observation):
    x_pos, y_pos, x_vel, y_vel, angle, ang_vel, left_contact, right_contact = observation
    action = 0  # Default action is to turn off all engines
    # Start immediate control of vertical descent
    if y_vel <= -0.1:  # Trigger engines to slow down descent early on
        action = 2
    # Correct larger angle deviations first
    if abs(angle) > 0.3: 
        action = 1 if angle > 0 else 3
    # Prioritize correcting horizontal drift while handling tilt
    elif abs(x_vel) > 0.2 or abs(ang_vel) > 0.3:
        if x_vel > 0.2:  # drifting right
            action = 1
        elif x_vel < -0.2:  # drifting left
            action = 3
    # Consistent control to slow descent
    if y_vel <= -0.5:  # Further slow vertical descent.
        action = 2
    return action
```
**Explanation**:
- Starting descent control early focusing on vertical speed reduction from the beginning.
- Continuous angle stabilization 
- Handling persistent horizontal drift, first correcting angles before significant changes to horizontal motion.

This should provide a progressive and corrective action model for consistent and stable landings.

### Analysis of the Logs

**Performance Differences**:
1. **Persistent Angle and Horizontal Velocity Issues**:
    - The spacecraft's angle (`angle`) and horizontal velocity (`x_vel`) increase continuously despite using the left engine for correction, indicating inadequate response to these variables.
2. **Incorrect Prioritization**:
    - The spacecraft is oscillating between various states without significant correction of horizontal or vertical velocities, due to over-reliance on the left engine without balancing the right engine properly.
3. **High Vertical Speed**:
    - The vertical velocity (`y_vel`) is mostly neglected leading to a high negative score and uncontrolled descent.
4. **Consistent Correction Failure**:
    - No consistent reduction in horizontal drift or vertical speed decrease. The proper combination of actions to correct tilt and stabilize descent isn't executed well.

### Logical Adjustments

**1. Reduce Angle**:
Immediate angle correction if significant tilt exists (`abs(angle) > 0.5`).

**2. Vertical Speed**:
Reduce team contribution and gradually descend with consistent use of central engine (`action = 2`)

**3. Horizontal Drift Reduction**:
Balance left and right engine switches based on horizontal velocity (`x_vel` > 0.2 or `x_vel` < -0.2`). Establish priority depending on drift direction.

**4. Combine Tilt Correction with Drift**
Correct both drift motion and tilt synchronously; marginally correct tilt if speed corrected.

### Updated Strategy Code
```python
import numpy as np

def act(observation):
    x_pos, y_pos, x_vel, y_vel, angle, ang_vel, left_contact, right_contact = observation
    action = 0  # Default action is to turn off all engines

    # Correct large tilt first
    if abs(angle) > 0.3: 
        action = 1 if angle > 0 else 3

    # Reduce horizontal speed if angled
    if abs(x_vel) > 0.2 and abs(angle) < 0.3:
        action = 1 if x_vel > 0.2 else 3

    # Contain consistent descent speed
    if y_vel <= -0.1:  # Trigger central engines early
        action = 2

    # Contain extreme vertical speed greater than safe margin
    if y_vel <= -0.5:  # Further retaining level of vertical velocity.
        action = 2

    return action
```

### Explanation
- Resolve large tilt first.Put continuous gentle angle incline combined with central slow descend triggering balance dynamics.
- Prioritize reducing horizontal speed when angle within safe tolerance margins
- Ensure slow descent consistently

### Analysis of the Logs

**Performance Differences**:
1. **Angle and Horizontal Velocity Issues Persist**:
    - The spacecraft's angle (`angle`) and horizontal velocity (`x_vel`) increase continuously despite using the left engine for corrections. The corrective actions are insufficient to handle the growing drift and tilt.
2. **Vertical Velocity Neglected**:
    - The spacecraft's vertical velocity (`y_vel`) was not consistently managed, leading to a rapid uncontrolled descent.
3. **Consistent Correction Failure**:
    - The code's logic does not provide adequate correction to stabilize horizontal and vertical velocities, nor does it correct the angle effectively in time.

### Logical Adjustments

1. **Reduce Angle**:
First, ensure the angle is near zero before correcting other parameters.

2. **Consistent Vertical Speed Reduction**:
More frequent and earlier use of the central engine, especially when `y_vel` is too high.

3. **Horizontal Drift Control**:
Correct horizontal velocity continuously and early, combine angle corrections to balance the drift and tilt.

4. **Balanced Approach**:
Ensure a blend of corrections for angle, vertical, and horizontal velocities.

### Updated Strategy Code
```python
import numpy as np

def act(observation):
    x_pos, y_pos, x_vel, y_vel, angle, ang_vel, left_contact, right_contact = observation
    action = 0  # Default action is to turn off all engines

    # Correct large tilt first
    if abs(angle) > 0.3: 
        action = 1 if angle > 0 else 3

    # Reduce horizontal speed if angled
    if abs(x_vel) > 0.2 and abs(angle) < 0.3:
        action = 1 if x_vel > 0.2 else 3

    # Consistent vertical speed correction
    if y_vel <= -0.1:
        action = 2  # Apply central engine to reduce descent speed

    # Violent vertical velocity reduction
    if y_vel <= -0.5:  # Higher thresholds for vertical velocity
        action = 2

    # Balance decision if both horizontal and angle corrected
    if abs(x_vel) < 0.2 and abs(angle) < 0.3 and y_vel <= -0.1:
        action = 2

    return action
```

### Explanation
- First correct large tilt then combines continuous reduction for horizontal velocity.
- Maintain early control of vertical descend through consistent slowing down from central engine
- Adjust consistently without oscillation for blending stabilization principle see resulting corrections for angle using left and right engines in tandem rates.

### Analysis of the Logs

**Performance Issues**:
1. **Persistent Angle and Horizontal Velocity Problems**:
    - The spacecraft remains excessively tilted and subject to high horizontal velocities, indicating insufficient corrective actions.
2. **Vertical Velocity Not Adequately Controlled**:
    - The vertical velocity (`y_vel`) is not consistently managed, leading to rapid, uncontrolled descent. The vertical speed control is delayed and inconstant.
3. **Inconsistent Correction Strategy**:
    - The spacecraft oscillates between attempted corrections without effectively stabilizing horizontal or vertical velocities or angle.

### Key Adjustments

1. **Angle Correction Priority**:
First, reduce the large angle deviation before handling horizontal or vertical velocities.

2. **Continuous Vertical Speed Management**:
Apply more frequent and consistent use of the central engine early when vertical velocity is high.

3. **Balanced Horizontal Velocity Control**:
Continuously correct horizontal drift, especially when angle corrections are manageable. Combine tilt corrections with horizontal stabilization.

### Updated Strategy

```python
import numpy as np

def act(observation):
    x_pos, y_pos, x_vel, y_vel, angle, ang_vel, left_contact, right_contact = observation
    action = 0  # Default action is to turn off all engines

    # Correct significant tilt first
    if abs(angle) > 0.2:
        action = 1 if angle > 0 else 3

    # Consistent reduction of horizontal speed
    elif abs(x_vel) > 0.2:
        action = 1 if x_vel > 0 else 3

    # Maintain slow descent continuously
    elif y_vel <= -0.1:
        action = 2  # Central engine to manage slow descent

    # Aggressive vertical velocity reduction
    elif y_vel <= -0.5:
        action = 2  # Further central engine consistent vertical control

    return action
```

### Explanations
- Correct significant tilt deviations first (absolute angle > 0.2).
- Shift early adjustments to horizontal speed when angle corrections are manageable.
- Continually apply central engine to regulate slow descent and aggressive vertical velocity reduction, avoiding delayed action.
- Balance and consistent control combining angle, horizontal velocity correction.

### Reasoning and Analysis for Successful Landing ###

#### Step-by-Step Analysis ####

1. **Position and Velocity**
   - **X Position and Velocity:** Values 
     - Goal: X Position should close to 0.0, X Velocity should ideally be 0.0 at landing.
   - **Y Position and Velocity:** Values
     - Goal: Y Position should reach 0.0 (landing surface), Y Velocity should be low negative value close to 0.0 (slow descent).

2. **Angle and Angular Velocity**
   - **Angle:** Values
     - Goal: Angle should be as close to 0.0 as possible (vertical).
   - **Angular Velocity:** Values
     - Goal: Angular velocity should be close to 0.0 (stable).

3. **Contact Sensors**
   - **Left and Right Contact Sensors:** Values
     - Goal: Both should switch from 0 to 1 upon touching down.

4. **Scores and Penalties**
   - Scores are affected by position, velocities, angles, and engine usage.
   - Each correct action (stabilizing spacecraft) increases score.
   - Conversely, wrong actions (disturbing stability) decrease score.
   - Bonus points for landing plus penalties for crashes.

#### Conclusions from Logs ####

- **Successful Landings:** Maintain stability, smooth descent, minimal lateral movement.
- **Failed Landings:** Large X or Y velocities uncorrected, large angles or angular velocities uncorrected, crashes result in heavy penalties.

#### Optimal Strategy for Successful Landing ####

1. **Stabilize X Position and Velocity**
   - Use engine 1 (left) if X Velocity > 0
   - Use engine 3 (right) if X Velocity < 0
   - Avoid making X Position too far from 0.
2. **Control Y Position and Velocity**
   - Use engine 2 regularly to manage descent speed.
   - Ensure Y Velocity isn't negative fast to avoid crashes.
3. **Adjust Angle and Angular Velocity**
   - If angle < 0 (left-tilted) use engine 3, if angle > 0 (right-tilted) use engine 1.
   - Minimize angular velocity changes unless necessary.
4. **Final Touchdown**
   - X, Y Velocities close to 0, Angle close to 0 upon contact.
   - Smaller velocity on Y downward to avoid crashes.

The code to implement these strategies need to incorporate these principles.

### Performance Analysis and Identification of Errors ###

#### Observations from Logs ####
1. **Initial Steps**:
   - **Action 1, Switching Left Engine**: Generated increasing oscillations in angular velocity and positive drift in X Velocity.

2. **Mid-Flight Corrections**:
   - **Continuous Action 1**: Lead to increasing velocity and unstable pitch control.

3. **Descent Phase**:
   - **Frequent Use of Left Engine (Action 1)**: Did not control vertical descent efficiently; angular velocity became increasingly unstable.

4. **Crash Landing**:
   - **Action 3 Usage at End**: Aggressively corrected angles without stabilizing descent or maintaining low velocities.
   - Resulted in high angular velocities and significant pull sideways leading to a crash.

#### Analysis-based Modifications ####
1. **Initial Stabilization**:
   - Optimize X, Y velocities in early steps
   - If X velocity > 0, use Action 1 for stability else Action 3
   - When X position close to center, minimize engine use aggressively.

2. **Descent Management**:
   - Gradually and proportionally engage Action 2 to manage descent.
   - Ensure Y velocity maintains safe descent rate.

3. **Angular Adjustments**:
   - Responsibility to both minimize angular velocity and correct angle towards 0.
   - Use of Action 2 to correct if necessary and maintain positional commands.

4. **Final Landing Touchdown**:
   - All velocities minimized, use Action 2 effectively to maximize final touchdown.
   - Ensure any lateral movement well controlled eliminating drift.

Code should reflect organized and calculated response, learning from previous corrective measures that were sub-optimal.

Analyze the performance of the spacecraft and how it differs from the desired result. Be guided by the scoring system. Identify the cause of errors in your code and modify it without fear of making major changes. Think deeply about the priorities of your code and how to order and combine them correctly to achieve success. Remember that the code is a reflection of your reasoning and the way you approach the problem.

Razonamiento:
### Performance Analysis and Correction ###

#### Observations from Logs ####
1. **Initial Actions**
   - The spacecraft stabilizes its X velocity initially with left engine, leading to slight oscillations.
   - Without vertical stabilization, thereâs no solid control over descent speed.

2. **Middle Actions**
   - Constant Action 1 application leads to rising angular velocity.
   - Y velocity control delayed, leading to rapid descent and score penalties.

3. **Final Phase**
   - Overuse of Right Engine in later stages; resulted in uncontrollable oscillations.
   - Diverge into rapid negative scoring with frequent angular misalignments.

#### Plan for Modification ####
1. **Vertical Descent Prioritization**
   - Implement early and stronger center engine usage to provide consistent upward thrust.

2. **Proportional Adjustment of Angle**
   - Adjust angle responses to moderate levels preventing rapid over-corrections.

3. **Gradual Touchdown Approach**
   - Smooth descent even during attitude corrections ensuring score maximization overall.

### Revised Act Function ###
Address all identified critical issues .

Razonamiento:
### Data-Driven Adjustments for Improved Landing Function ###

#### Observations from Logs ####
1. **Initial Stabilization Phase**:
   - Continuous Action 1 led to stable X velocity but negative Y control.

2. **Descent to Mid-Flight Corrections**:
   - Delayed Y velocity correction with late stage Action 2.

3. **Inconsistent Final Phase**:
   - Frequent Action 3 use excessively addressed angular adjustments, rapidly oscillating.

#### Modification Plan ####
1. **Balanced Starting Sequence**:
   - Stronger early Action 2 usage to manage both X and Y velocities.
   - Interleaves proportional balancing engine applications for angular controls.

2. **Dynamic Descent Management**:
   - Ensuring responsiveness towards X velocity shifts with minimal corrections.
   - Continual Action 2 use maintaining downward path decreasing.

3. **Final Adjustment Phase**:
   - Ensure consistent and scheduled corrections flattening angles, reducing horizontal drift ensuring touchdown stability.

### Revised Act Function Implementation ###
- Revised logic based on observations and refined application of proportional control measures.

### Performance Review and Correction ###

#### Problematic Trend in Logs ####
1. **Excessive Usage of Action 2**:
   - Overuse led to significant scores deduction without proper Y velocity or angle corrections.

2. **Missed Angular Adjustment**:
   - Inconsistencies in angle corrections, resulting in significant angular drifts.

3. **Vertical Velocity Inefficiency**:
   - Prolonged upward thrust increased velocity and disregarded safe descent.

4. **Late-phase Rapid Descent and Scoring Deductions**:
   - The scoring system penalized rise in velocities leading to poor safe landing trajectory.

### Refined Strategy ####
1. **Balanced Initial Approach**:
   - Use of engines for early-stage slow descent ensuring consistent vertical velocity management.

2. **Proportional Angular Adjustments**:
   - Efficient angle stabilization with minimal corrections preventing rapid oscillations.

3. **Controlled Descent through Phases**:
   - Regulated combination, avoiding excessive upward thrust ensuring downward path.

### Optimized Act Function Code ###
This version accommodates the key identified issues providing holistic controlled landing dynamics:

Analyze the performance of the spacecraft and how it differs from the desired result. Be guided by the scoring system. Identify the cause of errors in your code and modify it without fear of making major changes. Think deeply about the priorities of your code and how to order and combine them correctly to achieve success. Remember that the code is a reflection of your reasoning and the way you approach the problem.

Razonamiento:
Analyzing the successful and unsuccessful landing attempts, the spacecraft's behavior can be broken down into several key observations and corresponding actions:

1. **X Position and Velocity**: Ideally, keep the spacecraft near the center (X position â 0) with minimal horizontal velocity (X velocity â 0). Pushing the left engine (Action 1) moves the spacecraft right, and pushing the right engine (Action 3) moves it left. Pushing both engines (Action 2) slightly affects the horizontal velocity but mainly affects vertical dynamics.
2. **Y Position and Velocity**: The goal is to reduce the Y velocity (downward speed) to zero as the spacecraft approaches the ground. Pushing both engines (Action 2) reduces the Y velocity (slows descent), while inaction (Action 0) allows gravity to increase the descent speed.
3. **Angle and Angular Velocity**: Keep the spacecraft vertical (Angle â 0) with minimal angular velocity. Horizontal adjustments (Action 1 or 3) affect the angle and angular velocity.
4. **Contact Sensors**: The spacecraft should land with both left and right contact sensors activated simultaneously, meaning it lands upright. This usually happens when Y position is zero or near zero.
5. **Scoring System Results**:
  - **Closer to landing area**: Higher score when X and Y positions are close to zero.
  - **Slower movements**: Higher score when X and Y velocities are near zero.
  - **Less tilt**: Higher score when the angle is zero or near zero.
  - **Engine Usage**: Left, right, and center engines consume scores continuously.
  - **Successful landing**: Scores over 200.

### Steps for Successful Landing:
1. **Minimize Horizontal Movement**: Use Actions 1 and 3 as needed to keep X position and velocity near zero.
2. **Control Descent Speed**: Use Action 2 judiciously to reduce Y velocity as the spacecraft approaches the ground.
3. **Maintain Vertical Orientation**: Use Actions 1 and 3 to keep the Angle near zero and reduce angular velocity.
4. **Final Descent and Touchdown**: Gradually reduce engine usage as the descent rate becomes minimal, ensuring both contact sensors activate simultaneously upon landing.
5. **Smooth Transition**: Fine-tune the use of engines to avoid abrupt changes that might destabilize the spacecraft.

Updating the `act` function to incorporate these observations and strategies will optimize the landing attempts.

Razonamiento:
Analyzing the logs from the recent attempt, it's clear that the spacecraft faced several key issues:

1. **Excessive Use of Side Engines (Action 1 and Action 3)**: The spacecraft increased its horizontal velocity and did not stabilize its angle, which led to the angle drifting significantly from 0 over time.
2. **Angle and Angular Velocity Control**: The spacecraft's angle increased continuously, leading to stability issues. Even though the code attempted to adjust based on the angle, it resulted in continuous use of the side engines, which exacerbated the problem.
3. **Insufficient Control of Descent Rate**: The spacecraft did not appropriately manage its vertical velocity. An effective descent strategy would require prioritizing control of Y velocity before worrying excessively about horizontal corrections.
4. **Score Loss Due to Engine Usage**: Excessive engine use, especially the center engine, led to score penalties.

### Refined Strategy for Successful Landing
1. **Primary Priority**: Stabilize angle and reduce angular velocity to near zero early in the descent. This can be achieved by using side engines sparingly and effectively.
2. **Secondary Priority**: Control Y velocity to ensure a slow and steady descent. Use the center engine judiciously to reduce vertical speed as the spacecraft approaches the ground.
3. **Tertiary Priority**: Reduce horizontal velocity and correct the position to remain near the target landing zone.
4. **Judicious Engine Use**: Minimize engine firing to conserve score, especially avoiding continuous use of side engines in consecutive frames.

The refined code will focus on managing the angle first, followed by the descent rate, and finally, horizontal corrections, ensuring smoother transitions and stability.

Analyze the performance of the spacecraft and how it differs from the desired result. Be guided by the scoring system. Identify the cause of errors in your code and modify it without fear of making major changes. Think deeply about the priorities of your code and how to order and combine them correctly to achieve success. Remember that the code is a reflection of your reasoning and the way you approach the problem.

2024-07-02 20:18:54,308 - INFO - Arguments: {'reasoning': 'The latest logs indicate several persistent issues and some new insights:\n1. **Angle and Angular Velocity Control**: The angle control improved initially, but after a few steps, the angle started diverging again. This implies that the simple threshold-based approach is insufficient. The spacecraft\'s tilt and changing angular velocity need more dynamic adjustments.\n2. **Vertical Descent Rate**: The vertical descent was relatively stable, but the score impact due to continued usage of engines was still significant. Hence, a more refined strategy is required that uses the center engine sparingly.\n3. **Excessive Engine Use**: The alternate firing between left and right engines caused continued oscillation, which degraded performance. The back-and-forth corrections must be minimized, and a more stable state maintained.\n4. **Complex Maneuver Handling**: In the scenario where both horizontal and vertical adjustments were needed, the current strategy failed to prioritize correctly, leading to instability.\n5. **Contact Sensors and Score Impact**: We need to ensure smoother landings by more controlled engagements near landing conditions to maximize scores near final contact.\n\n### Improved Strategy for Successful Landing:\n1. **Primary Focus**: Immediate stabilization of angle and angular velocity, avoiding excessive oscillations through a compounded approach that considers both direction and rate of change.\n2. **Secondary Focus**: Controlled descent speed adjustments with center engine usage only when clear thresholds are violated.\n3. **Tertiary Focus**: Simultaneous stabilizing horizontal dynamics as the angle parameters become stable.\n4. **Engine Usage Efficiency**: Utilize engines sparingly, ensuring minimal corrections while maximizing stability, avoiding continuous smoke penalties.\n\n### Updated Act Function\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef act(observation):\n    \'\'\'\n    The function that codifies the action to be taken in each instant of time.\n\n    Args:\n        observation (numpy.array):\n            "description": "The state of the environment after the action is taken.",\n            "positions": {  \n                "0": "X position",\n                "1": "Y position",\n                "2": "X velocity",\n                "3": "Y velocity",\n                "4": "Angle",\n                "5": "Angular velocity",\n                "6": "Left contact sensor",\n                "7": "Right contact sensor"\n            },\n            "min_values": [-1.5, -1.5, -5.0, -5.0, -3.14, -5.0, 0, 0],\n            "max_values": [1.5, 1.5, 5.0, 5.0, 3.14, 5.0, 1, 1]\n\n    Returns:\n        Integer  : The action to be taken.\n        "options": {\n                \'0\' : "Switch off engines",\n                \'1\' : "Push left engine",\n                \'2\' : "Push both engines (upwards)",\n                \'3\' : "Push right engine"\n            }\n    \'\'\'\n    X_pos, Y_pos, X_vel, Y_vel, angle, ang_vel, left_contact, right_contact = observation\n\n    #

Razonamiento:
The latest logs indicate several persistent issues and some new insights:
1. **Angle and Angular Velocity Control**: The angle control improved initially, but after a few steps, the angle started diverging again. This implies that the simple threshold-based approach is insufficient. The spacecraft's tilt and changing angular velocity need more dynamic adjustments.
2. **Vertical Descent Rate**: The vertical descent was relatively stable, but the score impact due to continued usage of engines was still significant. Hence, a more refined strategy is required that uses the center engine sparingly.
3. **Excessive Engine Use**: The alternate firing between left and right engines caused continued oscillation, which degraded performance. The back-and-forth corrections must be minimized, and a more stable state maintained.
4. **Complex Maneuver Handling**: In the scenario where both horizontal and vertical adjustments were needed, the current strategy failed to prioritize correctly, leading to instability.
5. **Contact Sensors and Score Impact**: We need to ensure smoother landings by more controlled engagements near landing conditions to maximize scores near final contact.

### Improved Strategy for Successful Landing:
1. **Primary Focus**: Immediate stabilization of angle and angular velocity, avoiding excessive oscillations through a compounded approach that considers both direction and rate of change.
2. **Secondary Focus**: Controlled descent speed adjustments with center engine usage only when clear thresholds are violated.
3. **Tertiary Focus**: Simultaneous stabilizing horizontal dynamics as the angle parameters become stable.
4. **Engine Usage Efficiency**: Utilize engines sparingly, ensuring minimal corrections while maximizing stability, avoiding continuous smoke penalties.

Razonamiento:
From reviewing the recent logs, here are the persistent issues and insights:

1. **Excessive Engine Use (Horizontal Control)**: Even with the angle control, continuous use of left and right engines persists, leading to oscillations and increased horizontal speed.
2. **Angle and Angular Velocity Control**: While combined, the strategy still fails at dynamically responding to changing velocities quickly enough, often leading to opposite engine fires which compound the problem.
3. **Vertical Descent and Engine Use**: Over-correcting with the center engine (Action 2) was noted, thus repeated vertical descents remained unstable particularly near critical phases.
4. **Contact and Land Efficiency**: Improvements still required for contact sensor utilization to reflect touchdown dynamics effectively.

### Updated Strategy for Successful Landing:
1. **Primary Focus**: Simplify combined logic for angle and angular velocity independently stabilizing at early descent stages and dynamic scenario-based adjustments.
2. **Secondary Focus**: Vertical descent control with Action 2 dynamically adjusted when the vertical speed limit is critically exceeded or other scenarios present such as approach dynamics.
3. **Tertiary Focus**: Horizontal position corrections combining stable angle centered prioritization above forcible adjustments.
4. **Efficient Engine Use**: Introduce stasis-maximizing contradictions while suppressing over-firing engines dynamically.

2024-07-03 20:14:21,818 - INFO - To achieve a successful landing in the spacecraft landing environment, it's essential to understand each observation's values and the effects of each action. Here's a detailed breakdown:

### Observation Values Explained:

1. **X Position:** 
   - The horizontal position of the spacecraft relative to the landing zone.
   - Range: [-1.5, 1.5]

2. **Y Position:**
   - The vertical position of the spacecraft.
   - Range: [-1.5, 1.5]

3. **X Velocity:**
   - The horizontal velocity of the spacecraft.
   - Range: [-5.0, 5.0]

4. **Y Velocity:**
   - The vertical velocity of the spacecraft.
   - Range: [-5.0, 5.0]

5. **Angle:**
   - The angle of the spacecraft relative to vertical.
   - Range: [-3.14, 3.14] (in radians, negative for left, positive for right)

6. **Angular Velocity:**
   - The rate of change of the angle.
   - Range: [-5.0, 5.0]

7. **Left Contact Sensor:**
   - Indicates whether the left side of the spacecraft is in contact with the landing zone.
   - Values: [0, 1]

8. **Right Contact Sensor:**
   - Indicates whether the right side of the spacecraft is in contact with the landing zone.
   - Values: [0, 1]

### Action Effects:

1. **Switch off engines (0):**
   - No thrust is applied.
   - The spacecraft will continue its motion due to existing velocity and gravity.

2. **Push left engine (1):**
   - Applies thrust to the right.
   - Increases the angle (rotates counterclockwise).
   - Slightly changes X and Y velocities.

3. **Push both engines upwards (2):**
   - Applies downward thrust to reduce vertical velocity.
   - Slightly adjusts X velocity due to corrections.
   - Reduces vertical speed, crucial for a safe landing.

4. **Push right engine (3):**
   - Applies thrust to the left.
   - Decreases the angle (rotates clockwise).
   - Slightly changes X and Y velocities.

### Steps to Achieve a Successful Landing:

1. **Control Initial Conditions:**
   - Ensure the starting X velocity is moderate. High initial speeds can make it difficult to stabilize.

2. **Reduce Angular Velocity and Stabilize Angle:**
   - Use actions 1 and 3 periodically to reduce any initial angular velocity and achieve a near-zero angle.

3. **Reduce Vertical Velocity:**
   - Primarily use action 2 to decrease the descent speed. Keep the Y velocity within safe limits to ensure a soft landing.

4. **Control Horizontal Position and Velocity:**
   - Use a combination of actions 1, 2, and 3 to finely adjust the X position, keeping it close to the target and reducing the X velocity near zero.

5. **Avoid Overcorrecting:**
   - Actions must be balanced to avoid wild oscillations in angle and velocities.

6. **Reduce Engine Usage Over Time:**
   - Firing engines consumes points. Optimize engine usage to maintain high scores while ensuring a safe descent.

### Analyzing Example Logs:

By comparing the successful and unsuccessful landing attempts:
- **Successful landing**: Constantly adjusted Y velocity with frequent action 2. Controlled angle using actions 1 and 3 in a balanced way.
- **Unsuccessful attempt**: Overused actions 1 and 3, causing high angular velocities and instability. Inefficient control of X and Y velocities.

### Summary:

To maximize the score and achieve a successful landing:
1. Stabilize the angle to near zero using actions 1 and 3.
2. Periodically use action 2 to control the descent speed.
3. Maintain X velocity close to zero.
4. Use engines judiciously to avoid excessive point loss.
5. Ensure the spacecraftâs vertical and horizontal positions are aligned with the landing zone. 

These insights will guide refining the algorithm to enhance performance, stabilize descent, and maximize the score.

Analyzing the provided logs and understanding the relationships between actions, observations, and outcomes allows us to derive important information about optimal landing strategies. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the effects and required steps for successful landing:

1. **Observation Values and Their Meanings:**
   - **X position (observation[0])**: Horizontal distance from the landing zone center.
   - **Y position (observation[1])**: Vertical distance from the landing zone (altitude).
   - **X velocity (observation[2])**: Horizontal speed; should be minimized for landing stability.
   - **Y velocity (observation[3])**: Vertical speed; must be slow for safe landing.
   - **Angle (observation[4])**: Angle relative to the vertical line; should be close to 0 for successful landing.
   - **Angular velocity (observation[5])**: Rate of change of the angle; should be minimized.
   - **Left contact sensor (observation[6])**: Indicates contact (1 if contact, 0 otherwise).
   - **Right contact sensor (observation[7])**: Indicates contact (1 if contact, 0 otherwise).

2. **Effects of Actions on the Current State: Changes in observation values:**
   - **Action 0 (Switch off engines)**: Natural descent; affects Y velocity and angular velocity based on prior state.
   - **Action 1 (Push left engine)**: Increases angular velocity to the right and slightly affects X position and velocity to the right.
   - **Action 2 (Push both engines upwards)**: Decelerates descent (Y velocity), affects Y position; slight stabilization on Z position and angle.
   - **Action 3 (Push right engine)**: Increases angular velocity to the left, affects X position and velocity to the left.

3. **Steps to Follow to Achieve a Successful Landing:**
   - **Vertical Descent Control**: Use Action 2 to reduce Y velocity for a slow descent.
   - **Horizontal Stabilization**: Apply Action 1 and Action 3 strategically to correct horizontal drift and rotation.
   - **Minimize Angular Velocity**: Synchronous control with Actions 1 and 3 to stabilize the angle to near 0.
   - **Avoid Overshooting**: Monitor changes resulting from each action to prevent overcorrection.
   - **Last Phase Preparation**: Near the ground, fine-tune using minimal but necessary actions to stabilize and ensure both sensors (contact points) touch down lightly.

Here is the adjusted decision logic code that implements a basic version of the above steps into continuous action guidance for landing:

    max_yvel = -0.2  # More negative means going down too fast
    max_angle = 0.1

    # Action decision logic
    if ypos > 0.5:  # Higher altitude, prioritize stabilizing descent and horizontal position
        if abs(angle) > max_angle or abs(ang_vel) > 0.1:  # Need to stabilize angle
            return 1 if angle < 0 else 3

            return 1 if xvel > 0 else 3
    elif ypos > 0.1:  # Medium altitude, fine tuning positions and angles
        if abs(angle) > max_angle:  # Stabilize
            return 1 if angle < 0 else 3
        elif abs(xvel) > 0.05:  # Further reduce horizontal speed
            return 1 if xvel > 0 else 3
        elif yvel < target_yvel:  # Apply gentle descent
            return 2
    else:  # Near ground, ensure contacts are light and balanced
        if not (left_contact and right_contact):  # Contacts not touched down

            elif abs(angle) > max_angle:  # Stabilize angle
                return 1 if angle < 0 else 3

Analyze the performance of the spacecraft and how it differs from the desired result. Be guided by the scoring system. Identify the cause of errors in your code and modify it without fear of making major changes. Think deeply about the priorities of your code and how to order and combine them correctly to achieve success. Remember that the code is a reflection of your reasoning and the way you approach the problem.

Razonamiento:
Upon analyzing the logs from the last landing attempt, there are several points where the performance of the spacecraft can be optimized based on the score deductions and the observations made. Here's a detailed evaluation and the plan to correct the issues:

1. **Early Stages (High Altitude):**
    - **Issue:** At high altitudes, the code is primarily focusing on angle correction using actions 1 and 3, but the vertical descent could be smoother with more emphasis on reducing vertical speed.
    - **Correction:** Introduce early vertical speed stabilization by using Action 2 more proactively.

2. **Mid Altitude:**
    - **Issue:** The spacecraft showed stabilization issues with consistent employment of Action 3, leading to undesired horizontal changes and angular velocity adjustments.
    - **Correction:** Reduce the use of Action 3 unless strong horizontal or angular correction is needed. Prioritize vertical speed stabilization during this phase.

3. **Low Altitude:**
    - **Issue:** There was a lack of adequate horizontal stabilization, leading to high horizontal velocities and eventual crashing.
    - **Correction:** Focus on horizontal speed and angle correction evenly while approaching the ground. Use small adjustments to ensure smooth touchdown.

4. **Overall Strategy:**
    - Ensure that the reduction in vertical speed does not induce horizontal instability.
    - Balance actions to reduce any strong angular velocities that can cause crashes.
    - Fine-tuning horizontal position and angular velocity should be prioritized as the spacecraft approaches lower altitudes.

Razonamiento:
Upon analyzing the logs from the last landing attempt, several points can be optimized based on the score deductions and the observations made. Here's a detailed evaluation and the plan to correct the issues:

1. **Early Stages (High Altitude):**
    - **Issue:** At high altitudes, the code is primarily focusing on angle correction using actions 1 and 3, but the vertical descent could be smoother with more emphasis on reducing vertical speed.
    - **Correction:** Introduce early vertical speed stabilization by using Action 2 more proactively.

2. **Mid Altitude:**
    - **Issue:** The spacecraft showed stabilization issues with consistent employment of Action 3, leading to undesired horizontal changes and angular velocity adjustments.
    - **Correction:** Reduce the use of Action 3 unless strong horizontal or angular correction is needed. Prioritize vertical speed stabilization during this phase.

3. **Low Altitude:**
    - **Issue:** There was a lack of adequate horizontal stabilization, leading to high horizontal velocities and eventual crashing.
    - **Correction:** Focus on horizontal speed and angle correction evenly while approaching the ground. Use small adjustments to ensure smooth touchdown.

4. **Overall Strategy:**
    - Ensure that the reduction in vertical speed does not induce horizontal instability.
    - Balance actions to reduce any strong angular velocities that can cause crashes.
    - Fine-tuning horizontal position and angular velocity should be prioritized as the spacecraft approaches lower altitudes.

Here's the updated modified code which prioritizes stabilization and smooth descent using finer controls in different altitude levels:

```python

    max_yvel = -0.2  # More negative means going down too fast
    max_angle = 0.05  # Slightly tighter control on angle

    # Action decision logic
    if ypos > 0.5:  # Higher altitude, prioritize stabilizing descent and horizontal position
        if yvel < max_yvel:  # Too fast vertical descent
            return 2
        elif abs(angle) > max_angle or abs(ang_vel) > 0.1:  # Need to stabilize angle
            return 1 if angle < 0 else 3

Analyzing the logs generated by the new code, it becomes apparent that the spacecraft's descent and stabilization processes require significant adjustments. Here is a detailed analysis and the required modifications:

1. **Multiple Unnecessary Actions:**
    - **Issue:** The current decision logic results in multiple actions in quick succession that do not optimally contribute to stabilization.
    - **Correction:** Simplify and streamline the conditions for taking specific actions to avoid excessive and counterproductive adjustments.

2. **High Angular Velocity and Angle:**
    - **Issue:** High angular velocities and angles are too frequent, causing instability and significant score deductions.
    - **Correction:** Incorporate tighter control mechanisms for angle and angular velocity corrections, ensuring that any deviation is addressed sooner and more effectively.

3. **Excessive Use of Side Engines:**
    - **Issue:** Overuse of actions 1 and 3 (side engines), causing horizontal and rotational instabilities, as well as greater fuel consumption leading to higher score penalties.
    - **Correction:** Utilize side engines more judiciously, focusing on maintaining minimal angle and horizontal velocity without excessive corrections.

4. **Vertical Velocity Management:**
    - **Issue:** Inadequate control over vertical velocity, leading to abrupt and unsafe descent patterns.
    - **Correction:** Implement a more nuanced handling of vertical velocity, ensuring smoother and controlled descent using action 2 more effectively.

Here's the significantly adjusted code with streamlined logic and prioritized stabilization through smaller, more effective corrections:

        elif abs(xvel) > 0.02:  # Maintain low horizontal speed
            return 1 if xvel > 0 else 3

Razonamiento:
Upon analyzing the logs, it's evident that there is still room for improvement. The main issues identified are frequent use of side engines causing horizontal instability, excessive angular velocity leading to high angle deviations, and overall lack of smooth descent. To address these issues, a more nuanced approach to action selection and priorities is necessary.

### Key Observations and Changes Needed:
1. **Excessive Use of Side Engines: (Action 1 and 3)**
   - **Issue:** Overuse leads to high horizontal velocities and angles, causing corrections to be counterproductive.
   - **Solution:** Use side engines more sparingly and introduce conditions to correct angles only when significantly deviant.

2. **Controlled Descent with Central Engine (Action 2):**
   - **Issue:** Not sufficient utilization of Action 2 to maintain a controlled vertical descent.
   - **Solution:** Prioritize vertical descent correction by using Action 2 earlier and more frequently to maintain a steady descent rate.

3. **Enhanced Angle Control:**
   - **Issue:** High angles and angular velocities lead to unstable descent.
   - **Solution:** Implement tighter angle control throughout the descent process, applying corrections before deviations become too large.

### Revised Code Approach:
The code below reflects these considerations by better balancing the usage of side engines and the central engine to maintain a stable and smooth descent, focusing on reducing excessive corrections:

                return 3
        if yvel < target_yvel:  # Control descent speed
            return 2
    else:  # Very near ground, ensure stable touchdown
        if not (left_contact and right_contact):  # Touchdown stability
            if abs(xvel) > 0.01:  # Minimize lateral drift
                if xvel > 0:
                    return 1
                if xvel < 0:

            if abs(angle) > max_angle:  # Prevent tilt at touchdown
                if angle < 0:
                    return 1
                if angle > 0:

Razonamiento:
Upon detailed analysis, it is evident that side engines (Actions 1 and 3) are overused, causing instability and erratic descent. The code needs to be revised to correct these issues and ensure smoother, controlled descent by prioritizing central engine usage (Action 2) and minimizing corrections with side engines.

Here's a structured plan for the modifications:

1. **Reduce Use of Side Engines:**
    - **Issue:** Overuse of side engines creates horizontal instability.
    - **Correction:** Introduce conditions to use side engines only when absolutely necessary, and prioritize maintaining a stable descent.

2. **Central Engine Priority:**
    - **Issue:** Insufficient usage of the central engine to maintain vertical stability.
    - **Correction:** Prioritize the use of Action 2 to control vertical descent more effectively.

3. **Angle Control:**
    - **Issue:** High angles and angular velocities indicate instability.
    - **Correction:** Implement immediate corrective actions for angle deviations beyond a tighter threshold.

### Updated Code
The code below aims to maintain the balance and ensure smoother descent with fewer but more meaningful corrections.

```python
import numpy as np

def act(observation):
    # Extract observations for better readability
    xpos, ypos, xvel, yvel, angle, ang_vel, left_contact, right_contact = observation
    
    # Target states for successful landing
    target_xvel, target_yvel = 0, -0.5  # Target gentle descent
    max_yvel = -1.0  # Max descent speed threshold
    max_angle = 0.1  # Max angle threshold
    min_angle_control = 0.02  # Minimal angle adjustment threshold

    # Action decision logic
    if ypos > 0.5:  # Higher altitude
        if abs(angle) > max_angle or abs(ang_vel) > 0.1:  # Stabilize angle early
            if angle < 0:
                return 1
            return 3
        if yvel < max_yvel:  # Control vertical speed

Analyze the performance of the spacecraft and how it differs from the desired result. Be guided by the scoring system. Identify the cause of errors in your code and modify it without fear of making major changes. Think deeply about the priorities of your code and how to order and combine them correctly to achieve success. Remember that the code is a reflection of your reasoning and the way you approach the problem.

Analyze the performance of the spacecraft and how it differs from the desired result. Be guided by the scoring system. Identify the cause of errors in your code and modify it without fear of making major changes. Think deeply about the priorities of your code and how to order and combine them correctly to achieve success. Remember that the code is a reflection of your reasoning and the way you approach the problem.

Analyze the performance of the spacecraft and how it differs from the desired result. Be guided by the scoring system. Identify the cause of errors in your code and modify it without fear of making major changes. Think deeply about the priorities of your code and how to order and combine them correctly to achieve success. Remember that the code is a reflection of your reasoning and the way you approach the problem.

2024-07-08 13:09:08,513 - INFO - Arguments: {'reasoning': "The previous attempt demonstrated an issue with maintaining a balanced descent, particularly with the angular correction and vertical speed management. The primary problems were excessive row-wise corrections, leading to poor score and eventual crash. This indicates that the strategy needs to be more refined in balancing the vertical descent and angular stabilization.\n\nThe new plan is to:\n1. Initially focus on stabilizing the spacecraftâs angle more rigorously to ensure it's vertical or close to it to avoid tilting issues.\n2.

Razonamiento:
The previous attempt demonstrated an issue with maintaining a balanced descent, particularly with the angular correction and vertical speed management. The primary problems were excessive row-wise corrections, leading to poor score and eventual crash. This indicates that the strategy needs to be more refined in balancing the vertical descent and angular stabilization.

The new plan is to:
1. Initially focus on stabilizing the spacecraftâs angle more rigorously to ensure it's vertical or close to it to avoid tilting issues.
2. Manage vertical speed more gradually by integrating vertical thrust adjustments based on the descent rate, avoiding rapid changes in thrust direction.
3. Horizontally align the spacecraft more intuitively based on its position.
4. Default to engine off if conditions are stable enough.

Here's the revised code implementing these strategies with minor adjustments:

Analyze the performance of the spacecraft and how it differs from the desired result. Be guided by the scoring system. Identify the cause of errors in your code and modify it without fear of making major changes. Think deeply about the priorities of your code and how to order and combine them correctly to achieve success. Remember that the code is a reflection of your reasoning and the way you approach the problem.

Razonamiento:
Based on the logs, the spacecraft did not descend effectively, and there was major fluctuation in actions leading to poor stability and eventual crash. To mitigate this, the new strategy prioritizes vertical speed and horizontal positioning more dynamically while continuing angle correction.

Actions based on refined priorities:
1. **Angle Correction**: Ensure angle correction if significantly deviated to maintain stabilization.
2. **Vertical Speed**: Control descent speed more precisely to approach ground steadily without rapid changes in thrust.
3. **Horizontal Adjustment**: Maintain position within optimal bounds to avoid side drifts.
4. **Combination Rules**: Integrate angle, speed, and position controls dynamically to smoothly approach the landing zone.

Revised code implementation:

Razonamiento:
The spacecraft continuously fails to achieve a stable descent, leading to crashes. The primary problems are the inability to adequately slow the descent, excessive fuel consumption, and poor horizontal stability.

The new approach should be:
1. **Moderate thrust usage**: Only use engines when necessary and minimize fuel consumption.
2. **Stabilize descent speed**: Slow down the descent when falling too quickly but avoid continuous engine usage.
3. **Maintain horizontal stability**: Adjust horizontal position steadily.
4. **Angle correction**: Correct any deviations from the vertical.

Hereâs the revised code implementing these strategies more effectively:

Analyze the performance of the spacecraft and how it differs from the desired result. Be guided by the scoring system. Identify the cause of errors in your code and modify it without fear of making major changes. Think deeply about the priorities of your code and how to order and combine them correctly to achieve success. Remember that the code is a reflection of your reasoning and the way you approach the problem.

Razonamiento:
Analyzing the logs, successful landing attempts require: (1) reducing horizontal and vertical velocities close to zero, (2) minimizing the angle to stay upright, (3) minimizing angular velocity, and (4) steady contact with the ground. The goal is to balance gentle descent, stability, and minimal drift to avoid crashing. Observational parameters include X and Y positions, velocities, angle, and angular velocity. Actions influence these states, with upwards and side thrusts controlling velocity and angle.

Steps to follow:
1. If the spacecraft is tilting, correct the angle using side engines (1 for left, 3 for right).
2. Use central engine (2) to manage descent speed when vertical velocity exceeds the threshold.
3. Adjust horizontal drift with side engines to align with the landing zone.

The improved `act` function should emphasize stability and gentle descent, activating engines only when necessary and prioritizing stability over aggression.

Analyze the performance of the spacecraft and how it differs from the desired result. Be guided by the scoring system. Identify the cause of errors in your code and modify it without fear of making major changes. Think deeply about the priorities of your code and how to order and combine them correctly to achieve success. Remember that the code is a reflection of your reasoning and the way you approach the problem.

Razonamiento:
Analyzing the performance logs, we observe several critical issues that led to failure:
1. **Excessive Reliance on Angle Correction**: The spacecraft constantly switched between pushing left and right engines to correct angles, resulting in increased lateral movement and angular instability.
2. **Delayed Descent Management**: The descent speed was only modestly controlled, leading to rapid downward velocity build-up.
3. **Unstable Horizontal Drift Management**: The horizontal drift management was not aggressive enough to counteract the drift effectively.
4. **Late Use of Central Engine**: The central engine, which provides crucial lift for descent control, was underutilized, leading to unchecked downward momentum.

### Improved Strategy
1. **Immediate Descent Control**: Using the central engine (2) should have the highest priority to manage descent speed whenever necessary.
2. **Angle and Angular Velocity Correction**: Prioritize stability by employing side engines (1 and 3) primarily when the angle or angular velocity deviate beyond thresholds.
3. **Horizontal Drift Management**: Monitor and correct horizontal drift using side engines if the velocities exceed specific limits.
4. **Throttle Engine Usage**: Minimize unnecessary thrust by switching off engines when stability is achieved.

The refined strategy involves actively combining these priorities while maintaining a real-time feedback loop for state adjustments, ensuring that the descent, stability, and alignment goals are pursued harmoniously.

Razonamiento:
Analyzing the logs, the primary issues observed include over-reliance on angle correction, inconsistent use of engines, and lack of smooth transition to stable landing. Here's the refined strategy:

### Key Observations:
1. **Over-correction**: Frequent toggling between side engines results in horizontal instability.
2. **Inconsistent Descent Management**: Delay in engaging central engine led to unchecked downward momentum.
3. **Suboptimal Sequencing**: Actions were often reacting to immediate states without a longer-term stabilization vision.

### Updated Strategy:
1. **Focus on Prioritized Sequential Actions**:
   - **Immediate Stopping Descent**: Highest priority is to control the descent speed using the central engine (2).
   - **Correct for Angle when Speed is Managed**: Engage side engines (1 and 3) once the descent speed is within safe limits.
   - **Manage Horizontal Drift in Parallel**: Adjust horizontal drift concurrently with descent control when speed is manageable.

2. **Throttle Engine Usage**: Engage engines as needed and switch them off promptly to avoid oscillations and energy wastage.

3. **Combined Stability Pursuit**: Simultaneously address multiple stability dimensions only when isolated parameters are under control.

Updated function to reflect this strategy:

Razonamiento:
Despite some improvements, the logs highlight multiple critical issues:
1. **Persistent Angle Correction**: Too frequent use of angle corrections, causing instability.
2. **Overuse of Vertical Thrust**: Using the central engine excessively without controlling horizontal drift effectively.
3. **Delayed Switching Off**: Engines remain on for too long, leading to oscillations and negative score impacts.
4. **Lack of Coordination Between Corrections**: Need for smoother transitions between controlling descent, angle, and drift.

### Updated Strategic Focus
1. **Balance Engine Use**: Higher integration among descent, angle correction, and drift management, switching engines off swiftly when stability is achieved.
2. **Immediate Stability Focus**: Prioritize achieving a stable descent vector before adjusting for drift and angle, with immediate cessation of engine use upon stabilization.
3. **Avoid Unnecessary Corrections**: Only engage corrections when deviations are significant enough to impact stability.

**Performance Analysis:**

From the logs, it's clear that the pattern of actions is overly focused on angle correction with insufficient attention to sustained downward velocity control and horizontal alignment. The balance of engine use remains skewed, resulting in a combination of mid-air oscillations and inadequate deceleration.

### Key Issues Identified:
1. **Overuse of Side Engines**: Constant switching between side engines for angle correction leads to instability.
2. **Delayed Engagement of Central Engine**: Descending velocity control is inconsistently managed, contributing to continuous negative scores due to rapid descent rate.
3. **Lack of Holistic Correction**: Efforts need to seamlessly integrate angle, drift, and descent corrections.
4. **Continuous Engine Engagement**: Excessive reliance on engine use without enough switch-off periods to stabilize descent.

### Strategic Adjustments:
1. **Initial Strong Descent Control Utilizing Central Engine**: When descent speed exceeds the safe limit, prioritize central engine use until stable descent is achieved. Focus on gradual deceleration.
2. **Angle and Drift Correction in Parallel**: If drift or angular deviation exists alongside a managed descent speed, prioritize a single strong correction at a time rather than toggling multiple engines rapidly.
3. **Smart Switching Off Engines**: As stability is approached, promptly switch off engines to avoid unnecessary use, ensuring smoother landings.

### Analysis & Reasoning

#### Observations and Values:
1. **X position (obs[0])** - Horizontal position relative to the landing zone.
2. **Y position (obs[1])** - Vertical position relative to the landing zone.
3. **X velocity (obs[2])** - Horizontal velocity; positive means moving right, negative means moving left.
4. **Y velocity (obs[3])** - Vertical velocity; positive means moving up, negative means moving down.
5. **Angle (obs[4])** - Angle relative to the vertical; positive means tilted right, negative means tilted left.
6. **Angular velocity (obs[5])** - Rate of change of the angle.
7. **Left contact sensor (obs[6])** - Whether the left side is in contact with the landing zone.
8. **Right contact sensor (obs[7])** - Whether the right side is in contact with the landing zone.

#### Effects of Actions on State Observations:
1. **Action 0: Switch off engines**
   - No thrust, the spacecraft continues to be influenced by gravity and existing velocities (X & Y).
   - Momentum and inertia continue to affect the angle and angular velocity.
2. **Action 1: Push left engine**
   - Increases X velocity to the right.
   - Decreases angle (counterclockwise rotation).
   - Can affect Y velocity if combined with the center engine.
3. **Action 2: Push both engines (upwards)**
   - Decreases Y velocity (counteracts gravity, slowing descent).
   - Minor impacts on X velocity and angle due to symmetrical thrust.
   - Major consumption of center engine fuel, reducing score heavily.
4. **Action 3: Push right engine**
   - Decreases X velocity (moves left).
   - Increases angle (clockwise rotation).
   - Can affect Y velocity if combined with the center engine.

#### Key Steps to Follow for a Successful Landing:
1. **Vertical Position (Y) and Velocity (Y):**
   - Gradually reduce vertical velocity to around -0.2 to -0.4 near the ground.
   - Utilize action 2 to decrease excessive descent speed.
2. **Horizontal Position (X) and Velocity (X):**
   - Correct any horizontal movement early using actions 1 and 3, keeping X velocity low.
   - Ensure the spacecraft is near the landing zone (X closest to 0).
3. **Angle and Angular Velocity:**
   - Minimize any angular tilt by using actions 1 and 3 to correct the angle.
   - Make sure the angle and angular velocity are close to zero as you approach the landing.
4. **Engine Usage: **
   - Avoid over-relying on the center engine (action 2) as it drastically reduces the score.
   - Carefully utilize the engines to balance between necessary thrust and minimizing score penalties.
5. **Sensors:**
   - Aim for both left and right contact sensors to show 1 simultaneously (successful landing).

### Enhanced Code:
Incorporate a simple heuristic approach to balance vertical descent rate, horizontal position, and tilt simultaneously, limiting the use of the center engine.

### Analysis of Performance and Errors

#### Performance Analysis:
1. **Horizontal Position and Velocity (X, X_velocity)**:
   - The spacecraft drifts significantly to the right and eventually ends up in negative X-positions with high negative X-velocities.
   - The correction for horizontal drift is not sufficient, indicating that the horizontal velocity handling needs refinement.
2. **Vertical Position and Velocity (Y, Y_velocity)**:
   - The vertical descent starts controlled but then the rate of descent increases drastically.
   - This suggests that the use of engines to control vertical velocity was delayed or insufficient.
3. **Angle and Angular Velocity**:
   - The angle becomes increasingly positive, and the angular velocity correction seems to be ineffective.
   - Both the angle and angular velocity need more aggressive correction.
4. **Engine Usage**:
   - Over-reliance on single engine correction (left engine) leads to significant penalties in the score.
   - Incorrect prioritization of actions that led to high negative scoring and eventual crash.

#### Priorities for Correction:
1. **Aggressive Correction of Y_velocity**: Prioritize reducing the vertical speed more effectively.
2. **Handling of X_velocity**: Introduce more balanced correction of horizontal drift, including both left and right engine use.
3. **Angle Stabilization**: Implement a stronger mechanism to neutralize the angle and angular velocity.
4. **Efficient Usage of Engines**: Avoid overusing single engines to minimize penalties.

#### Corrective Code Strategy:
1. **Early and Balanced Correction**: Introduce balanced correction strategies for X and Y velocity early in the descent.
2. **Angle Correction Mechanism**: Stronger priority for correcting angle and angular velocity to minimize tilt.
3. **Engine Mix Usage**: Implement a better mix and prioritization of engine use to address combined issues effectively.

### Analysis of Performance and Errors

#### Performance Analysis:
1. **Horizontal Position and Velocity (X, X_velocity)**:
   - The spacecraft rapidly increases its horizontal velocity to the right due to the repeated use of the right engine.
   - The excessive horizontal velocity caused the spacecraft to drift far away from the landing zone.
2. **Vertical Position and Velocity (Y, Y_velocity)**:
   - The vertical descent speed is relatively controlled but becomes problematic due to large horizontal drifts.
3. **Angle and Angular Velocity**:
   - The angle becomes increasingly negative, leading to rotation issues.
   - The angular velocity needs more effective management.
4. **Engine Usage**:
   - Over-reliance on the right engine (action 3) due to incorrect prioritization.
   - Incorrect prioritization of horizontal velocity correction over angle correction.

#### Priorities for Correction:
1. **Balanced and Timely Correction**: Correct horizontal and vertical velocity early and maintain balance in engine usage.
2. **Angle Stabilization**: Higher priority on balancing the angle and angular velocity.
3. **Efficient Engine Usage**: Avoid overcorrection and penalties from single engine overuse.

#### Corrective Code Strategy:
1. **Early and Balanced Correction**: Implement balanced correction strategies for horizontal and vertical velocities early in descent.
2. **Angle Correction Mechanism**: Implement stronger and earlier angle and angular velocity correction.
3. **Engine Mix Usage**: Implement a more balanced mix in engine usage to handle combined issues effectively.

### Analysis of Performance and Errors

#### Performance Analysis:
1. **Horizontal Position and Velocity (X, X_velocity)**:
   - The spacecraft increases its horizontal velocity rapidly, leading to excessive horizontal drift.
   - The horizontal velocity correction was too aggressive and not efficient.
2. **Vertical Position and Velocity (Y, Y_velocity)**:
   - The vertical speed was not effectively controlled, leading to high descent speeds.
   - Need better prioritization of controlling vertical speed.
3. **Angle and Angular Velocity**:
   - Excessive tilt occurred due to improper angle correction.
   - Angular velocity should be corrected earlier and more effectively.
4. **Engine Usage**:
   - Overuse of a single engine (right engine with action 3), causing high penalties and instability.
   - Inefficient mix of engine usage leading to compounded errors.

#### Priorities for Correction:
1. **Correction of Vertical Speed (Y_velocity)**: Prioritize maintaining a controlled vertical descent speed.
2. **Balanced Horizontal Velocity (X_velocity) Correction**: Ensure efficient and timely correction of horizontal drift using a balanced approach for left and right engines.
3. **Angle Stabilization**: Implement more aggressive correction for angle and angular velocity.
4. **Efficient Engine Usage**: Avoid overuse of single-engine actions and combine corrections to stabilize the descent.

#### Corrective Code Strategy:
1. **Early and Prioritized Correction**: Address vertical speed control early and maintain balance in engine usage.
2. **Angle Correction Mechanism**: Implement stronger and earlier angle and angular velocity correction.
3. **Balanced Engine Mix Usage**: Ensure a balanced and combined approach to handle corrections effectively.

### Analysis of Performance and Errors

#### Performance Analysis:
1. **Horizontal Position and Velocity (X, X_velocity)**:
   - Rapid horizontal velocity to the right led to excessive drifting.
   - Repeated use of the right engine worsened the drift instead of correcting it.
2. **Vertical Position and Velocity (Y, Y_velocity)**:
   - Insufficient control over the vertical descent speed caused high descent rates.
   - Prioritize better management of vertical velocity.
3. **Angle and Angular Velocity**:
   - Angle became increasingly negative, leading to worsen tilt.
   - Angular velocity correction was ineffective.
4. **Engine Usage**:
   - Over-reliance on right engine (action 3), causing high penalties and leading to instability.
   - Lack of balance in engine usage led to compounded errors.

#### Priorities for Correction:
1. **Vertical Speed Management (Y_velocity)**: Essential to keep vertical speed under control early.
2. **Balanced Correction for X_velocity and Angle**: Avoid overcorrection and ensure balanced approach to mitigate drift.
3. **Effective Angle Stabilization**: Implement stronger correction for angle and angular velocity.
4. **Engine Usage Optimization**: Reduce penalties by balanced and efficient engine usage.

#### Corrective Code Strategy:
1. **Early Control on Vertical Velocity**: Implement prioritized reduction in vertical speed.
2. **Balanced Correction Approaches**: Use a combined and balanced method for horizontal and angle stabilization.
3. **Angle and Angular Velocity Priority**: Correct angle and its velocity early and more effectively.
