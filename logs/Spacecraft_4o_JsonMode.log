Analyze the performance of the spacecraft and how it differs from the desired result. Be guided by the scoring system. Identify the cause of errors in your code and modify it without fear of making major changes. Think deeply about the priorities of your code and how to order and combine them correctly to achieve success. Remember that the code is a reflection of your reasoning and the way you approach the problem.

Razonamiento:
Upon analyzing the logged data from the latest landing attempt, the following points highlight the performance and necessary adjustments:

1. **Continuous Upward Thrust Issue**: The spacecraft consistently fired the main (upward) engine, causing upward acceleration and increasing y-position, contrary to the expected descent. This contributed to a highly negative score.
2. **Angle Correction Ignored**: Despite angular deviations, consistent corrective actions using side engines (actions 1 and 3) were omitted, resulting in high angular velocities and tilts.
3. **Horizontal and Vertical Thrust Correction**: Priority should be given to maintaining smooth horizontal and vertical deceleration as the spacecraft nears the ground while avoiding overuse of the main engine for extended periods.


a revised strategy focusing on prioritizing horizontal and vertical control while also correcting angular deviations is necessary. The approach should combine multiple checks into a cohesive priority system:

### Improved Strategy
1. **Address Critical Angular Deviations First**: Correct angle if significant to prevent uncontrollable tilting, ensuring stability first.
2. **Control Horizontal Velocity Next**: Correct any significant horizontal velocity to ensure vertical descent alignment with the landing pad area.
3. **Gradual Descent**: Maintain a gradual vertical descent by balancing upward thrust usage.
4. **Terminate Descent Gently**: Switch off engines when near the ground, maintaining stable descent via controlled actions and velocity checks.

### Enhanced act Method Implementation
This version combines primary checks in a prioritized order for effective state management and landing control:

Razonamiento:
Based on the latest logs, the spacecraft's performance suggests an overemphasis on the left engine (action 1), which resulted in substantial positive angle deviations and insufficient vertical velocity control. This led to the craft never properly descending, and ultimately crashing. Here's a refined approach:

### Observations:
1. **Overuse of Left Engine**: Consistently using action 1 caused significant tilting (positive angles) and deviation from vertical landing alignment.
2. **Lack of Vertical Thrust Control**: Few actions were dedicated to controlling vertical velocity, resulting in high descent speeds and insufficient soft landing preparation.

### Refined Priorities:
1. **Stabilization First**: Reintroduce priority checks for balanced horizontal and vertical velocity control. Ensure angle corrections where deviations are significant.
2. **Controlled Descent**: Employ vertical thrust strategically to manage descent speed smoothly.
3. **Gradual Reduction of Speed**: Switch off engines at lower altitudes but ensure horizontal alignment and minimal angle deviation for smooth landing.

### Updated Strategy Algorithm:
1. **Maintain Orientation**: Focus initially on stabilizing the spacecraft's orientation for controlled descent.
2. **Balanced Thrust Control**: Adjust thrust to minimize harsh accelerations. Control vertical velocity while compensating for horizontal drift.
3. **Preparing for Landing**: Gradually shut off engines as altitude reduces, focusing on low velocities and stable angles for landing.

Razonamiento:
Upon analyzing the logs, the continuous use of action '1' (left engine) caused the spacecraft to tilt excessively to the right. This led to instability and a failure to control vertical descent. The spacecraft never corrected its trajectory, leading to high velocities and an eventual crash. Here's what needs to be done:

1. **Angle Correction**: Ensure we correct the angle only if it's significantly deviated. Continuous minor corrections should be avoided to prevent oscillations.
2. **Horizontal Control**: Follow angle correction with horizontal stabilization to reduce horizontal drift.
3. **Vertical Descent Control**: Use controlled thrust to manage descent speed effectively.
4. **A More Holistic Approach**: Integrate checks to balance between angle, horizontal, and vertical controls without overusing the engines.

### Steps to Follow:
1. **Check Angle**: Only correct if deviation is significant.
2. **Check Horizontal Velocity**: Control substantial horizontal movement.
3. **Manage Vertical Descent**: Ensure smooth descent to avoid harsh landing impacts.
4. **Balanced Control Strategy**: Combine angle, horizontal, and vertical checks to balance actions efficiently.

Razonamiento:
Upon analyzing the latest logs, several critical observations and points for improvement can be identified:

1. **Overuse of Left Engine (Action 1)**: Consistent use of action 1 resulted in a steady decrease in the spacecraft's x and y velocities but failed to manage the descent properly.
2. **Inconsistent Descent Management**: The vertical descent was poorly managed, evidenced by fluctuating y velocities and a fleeting switch to action 2, which didn't stabilize the descent effectively.
3. **Lack of Sufficient Angle Correction**: Actions to counter significant angles should have been more dynamic to prevent tilting issues.

### Key Elements to Manage Proper Descent:
1. **Reduce Overuse of Left Engine (Action 1)**: Ensure left engine usage is balanced with other corrective actions to prevent x and y velocity fluctuations.
2. **Dynamic Angle Correction**: Implement more dynamic angle correction to maintain proper orientation relative to the ground more efficiently.
3. **Balanced Vertical Descent Control**: Ensure more frequent use of upward thrust (action 2) to control descent speed in combination with other corrective maneuvers.
4. **Critical Priority Adjustments**:
    - Manage significant angular deviations first
    - Address substantial horizontal velocities next
    - Control vertical velocities to ensure smooth landing

Razonamiento:
The key issues identified from the latest logs indicate that the spacecraft had excessive use of the left engine (Action 1), leading to positive angle deviations and limiting the correction of descent speed. This over-reliance on Action 1 caused continuous tilt to one side. Additionally, there was insufficient management of the vertical descent, as indicated by fluctuating vertical speed without adequate force to counteract it for a smooth landing. Here's a refined approach and strategy for improvement:

### Observations:
1. **Overuse of the Left Engine (Action 1)**: Consistently using the left engine without adequate balancing corrected angles intensely but failed to manage descent.
2. **Vertical Descent Management**: The vertical descent was poorly managed due to underuse of the upward thrust (Action 2), failing to control descent speed efficiently.
3. **Insufficient Angle Correction**: Proper angle correction needs more dynamic actions rather than only relying on the continuous adjustments.
4. **Overcorrecting with Horizontal Correction**: The spacecraft management should include dynamic horizontal speed correction to prevent velocity fluctuations and drifts.

### Improved Strategy:
1. **Angle Correction**: Implement a more dynamic correction for significant angular deviations to ensure stability before descending.
2. **Horizontal Velocity Control**: Balance horizontal speed correction effectively to prevent drifting. Adjust the code to ensure it mitigates overuse of a single engine for correction steps.
3. **Controlled Descent**: Use vertical thrust control adequately to manage and ensure a smooth descent strategically, avoiding high descent speeds and achieving a stable position for landing.
4. **Balanced Priorities**: Integrate checks dynamically to balance angle, horizontal, and vertical speed controls cohesively.

Reviewing the results, it is clear the persistent use of action '1' (left engine) created substantial positive angle deviations, leading to continuous drifting to the right. The craft did not adjust adequately to control its descent or manage horizontal and vertical stability, resulting in a crash. Here’s an improved approach considering corrective and balanced actions leveraging previous insights:

### Key Points for Improvement
1. **Angle Correction Only When Necessary:** Overuse of angle corrective actions led to incremental destabilization. Thus, use only when significant deviations occur.
2. **Balanced Ascent & Descent Management:** Ensure better balance between vertical ascent using both or center engines and descent control to manage smoother touchdowns and minimize harsh velocity changes.
3. **Effective Velocity Control:** Horizontal and vertical velocity corrections must align dynamically to changing conditions, ensuring smooth, responsive adjustments without systemic over-corrections.

### Steps to Follow:
1. **Angle Analysis and Correction:** Focus initially on stabilizing at smaller thresholds to prevent unnecessary movement and ensure vertical descent alignment.
2. **Horizontal Velocity Balancing:** Adjust horizontal velocity to reduce deviation and manage drift more effectively.
3. **Gradual Descent Control:** Implement combined upward thrusts and controlled engine use to guide speed adjustment progressively as altitude varies.
4. **Balancing Multiple Priorities:** Establish ordered priorities facilitating smooth, time-dependent adjustment to angular, horizontal, and vertical movement.

Razonamiento:
Deep reasoning involves understanding how each parameter in the observation affects the landing and then devising a logical strategy to adapt the actions. Here is a structured reasoning:

1. Parameters Analysis:
- **X position (0)**: Horizontal distance from the landing site center. We need to keep this close to 0 for a perfect landing.
- **Y position (1)**: Vertical height from the landing surface. Decreases as the lander comes down.
- **X velocity (2)**: Horizontal speed; ideally, this should be near 0 upon landing to avoid horizontal crash.
- **Y velocity (3)**: Vertical speed; should be near 0 for a soft landing.
- **Angle (4)**: The tilt angle of the lander. Ideally, this should be close to 0 upon landing to prevent tipping over.
- **Angular velocity (5)**: The rate of change in angle. Should be minimized to control steady descent.
- **Left contact sensor (6)**: Indicates touchdown of the left leg.
- **Right contact sensor (7)**: Indicates touchdown of the right leg.
- **Score**: A measure of landing quality based on proximity to center, speed, and tilt.

2. Action effects:
- **Switch off engines (0)**: allows the lander to fall freely under gravity.
- **Push left engine (1)**: Thrusts the lander rightward, counteracting left tilt and rightward movement.
- **Push both engines up (2)**: Slows descent (reduces `Y velocity`) and can minorly adjust `X velocity` and angle.
- **Push right engine (3)**: Thrusts the lander leftwards, counteracting right tilt and leftward movement.

3. Steps to Successful Landing:
- **Minimize `X velocity`**: Use `1` when moving right and `3` when moving left.
- **Control `Y velocity`**: Use `2` to decrease vertical speed; tap it periodically to manage descent speed.
- **Maintain angle**: Use `1` to increase right tilt and `3` for left tilt. `0` is used when you need to keep existing momentum and avoid over-thrusting.
- **Prioritize stability near the ground**: Upon nearing the surface (value of `Y position` getting small), ensure `X velocity`, `Y velocity`, and `Angle` are near-zero.

Razonamiento:
The last attempt shows the spacecraft constantly applying side thrust (action 1) which has caused persistent lateral movement and spin. This caused erratic and excessive movement, leading to -707.127 score. The key issues were:
1. Overcorrection, causing continuous leftward movement and spin.
2. Improper prioritization, leading to excessive angle and velocity changes.
3. Insufficient vertical thrust to mitigate downward velocity.

Prioritized Revisions:
1. **Reduce `X velocity`**: Immediate correction based on horizontal velocity.
2. **Control `Y velocity`**: Maintain near-zero descent rate.
3. **Maintain angle**: Ensure minimal tilt for a smooth touchdown.
4. **Avoid excessive correction**: Use combined engine thrust more strategically.
5. **React to landing sensor**: Stop engines once landed.

Revised approach:
- Immediately correct `X velocity` while ensuring the lander remains balanced.
- Apply upward thrust only when necessary to control descent.
- Minor corrections to angle to keep it within a safe range (near-zero).
- Stop applying actions once sensors indicate contact (left and right).

Razonamiento:
The recent attempt shows persistent issues with maintaining stability and controlling descent, resulting in a dismal score of -547.043. The spacecraft fails to balance its thrust and corrective measures, leading to an unstable descent, high tilt angles, and excessive horizontal and vertical velocities. Observations indicate that: 
1. **Horizontal velocity** was not effectively managed, which allowed uncontrolled lateral movements.
2. **Angle and angular velocity** increased dramatically, suggesting overcorrection or mismanaged thrust.
3. **Vertical velocity** quickly escalated, indicating insufficient thrust control in slowing descent.

To address these issues, the strategy must focus on the following enhancements:
1. **Horizontal velocity control**: Immediate correction using minimal thrust at the right time to avoid oscillations.
2. **Angle stabilization**: Applying smaller corrective thrusts to minimize tilt without creating instability.
3. **Vertical descent management**: Utilizing thrust to reduce vertical speed but avoiding continuous thrust that creates further instability.
4. **Priority management**: Structuring the code to focus on crucial parameters (e.g., horizontal stability first, then angle, then vertical descent).
5. **Testing for stability**: Ensuring final actions cater to minimal movement in all axes upon nearing touchdown.

Razonamiento:
Upon reviewing the logs of the current attempt, it's clear that the spacecraft overcorrected, leading to consistent inappropriate thrusting actions. This has caused: 
1. **Persistent lateral movement**, hence moving away from the target landing area. The scores reflect a decline which suggests unnecessary side thrust.
2. **Increasing angle and angular velocity**, leading to a significant tilt. The spacecraft failed to maintain an upright posture due to poor angle control.
3. **Unstable descent** as it didn't consistently regulate the vertical speed.

Key corrective actions needed:
1. **Immediate correction of lateral movement based on fine-tuned velocity thresholds**: Finer control of `x_vel` and `angle` is necessary to avoid overcorrecting and introducing instability.
2. **Refined angle stabilization**: Smaller angle adjustment to avoid large corrections that cause instability.
3. **Controlled descent velocity**: Use thrust only when necessary, prioritized gently at higher altitudes and more rigorously as it nears the surface.
4. **Enhanced priority management**: Structuring actions to first correct excessive horizontal movements, then angle corrections, and finally vertical descent stabilization.

Revised Algorithm to refine control logic and eliminate inappropriate action sequences:

Razonamiento:
The logs from the last attempt indicate that the lion's share of the errors arose due to the persistent application of the left engine action (Action 1). This led to a predictable and incremental increase in both horizontal and angular velocities, eventually causing the spacecraft to veer away significantly from the optimal trajectory and crash, leading to a considerable cumulative score deduction. The primary issues identified were as follows:

1. **Constant Over-reliance on Action 1 (Left Engine Thrust)**: Overuse caused an increasing tilt and deviation towards the right side.
2. **Ineffective Angle and Vertical Velocity Control**: Persistent thrusts led to increased instability and higher descent rates.
3. **Lack of Corrective Actions**: No adaptive measures were taken to correct the over-application of the left engine.

To rectify these issues, we must rethink this algorithm with better-balanced corrective mechanisms. Specifically, it must:

1. **Implement Balanced Engine Usage**: Action distribution should be both informed by sensors and adaptive.
2. **Improve Angle Correction**: Tilt corrections need to be responsive and balanced against maintaining overall descent stability.
3. **Incorporate a More Dynamic Descent Profile**: Utilize thrust more judiciously for vertical speed control.

With these updates in mind, here is a restructured and more iteratively dynamic approach to achieving an optimal landing profile:

Razonamiento:
First, let's break down the logs and understand the key variables and actions that affect the landing of the spacecraft. Below is an explanation of the key variables and how the actions impact these variables:

### Key Variables:
1. **X position**: The spacecraft's horizontal position relative to the landing zone. Ranges from -1.5 to 1.5.
2. **Y position**: The spacecraft's vertical position relative to the landing zone. Ranges from -1.5 to 1.5.
3. **X velocity**: The horizontal speed at which the spacecraft is moving. Ranges from -5.0 to 5.0.
4. **Y velocity**: The vertical speed at which the spacecraft is descending or ascending. Ranges from -5.0 to 5.0.
5. **Angle**: The tilt of the spacecraft relative to the vertical position, ranges from -3.14 to 3.14 radians.
6. **Angular velocity**: The rate at which the spacecraft's angle is changing. Ranges from -5.0 to 5.0.
7. **Left contact sensor**: Indicates if the left side of the spacecraft has touched the landing zone. Can be either 0 or 1.
8. **Right contact sensor**: Indicates if the right side of the spacecraft has touched the landing zone. Can be either 0 or 1.
9. **Score**: The score associated with the current state.

### Effects of Actions:
1. **0 - Switch off engines**: No propulsion is applied. The spacecraft continues to move based on its current velocities.
2. **1 - Push left engine**: Increases horizontal velocity to the right and induces a counterclockwise rotation.
3. **2 - Push both engines (upwards)**: Decreases vertical velocity by providing upward thrust. Keeps the spacecraft relatively vertical if there is no angular motion.
4. **3 - Push right engine**: Decreases horizontal velocity to the left and induces a clockwise rotation.

### Steps to Follow for a Successful Landing:
1. **Stable Descent**: Maintain a steady vertical descent rate (Y velocity). Avoid sharp increases in Y velocity to prevent crashing.
2. **Minimize Tilt**: Keep the angle close to 0 to ensure the spacecraft is upright. Use left and right engines to counteract any tilting motion.
3. **Slow Down**: As the spacecraft approaches the landing zone, reduce both X and Y velocities to minimal levels to make a gentle landing.
4. **Position Control**: Keep X position as close to 0 as possible. If the spacecraft drifts horizontally, use left and right engines to bring it back in line.
5. **Landing Sensors**: Ensure both contact sensors are activated simultaneously for a stable touchdown.

### Implementing the Code:
Next, we'll update the `act` function to follow these steps. The function will use conditional statements to choose actions that help achieve a stable descent, minimize tilt, slow down, and ensure a good position for landing.

Razonamiento:
The logs reveal several key areas where adjustments need to be made to improve the landing algorithm. Observations from the logs show that the spacecraft frequently has problematic X and Y velocities, tilts significantly, and often fails to return to a stable descent. Here are specific logs insights and subsequent modifications:

### Observations:
1. **Excessive Horizontal Movement**: The X position changes frequently and exceeds safe limits quickly (e.g., from 0.008 to 0.246 within a few time steps).
2. **High Descent Speed**: Y velocity is often too high, leading to a crash scenario.
3. **Large Tilts**: The angle deviates significantly, pointing to poorly managed angular velocities.
4. **Reactive Measures Needed**: The agent must respond quicker to errant angles and velocities.

### Modifications to the Algorithm:
1. **Reduce Horizontal Movements**: Prioritize keeping the X position close to zero with greater responsiveness to horizontal shifts.
2. **Maintain a Controlled Descent**: Actively use the vertical thruster when descent speed is too high.
3. **Stabilize Angle More Effectively**: Counteract any tilt immediately and if the angle remains off by more than 0.1 radians, it needs correction.
4. **Sequential Priority in Actions**: Establish a hierarchy where stability in angle and descent rates come first, followed by horizontal corrections.
5. **Preemptive Checks**: Apply preemptive actions sooner to adjust velocities and angles before they become critical.

### Code Revisions:
We'll embody this plan in the revised `act` function to ensure the spacecraft meets the ideal conditions for a successful landing. The function now prioritizes maintaining vertical stability, minimising descent speed, and correcting sideways drifts, in that order:

Razonamiento:
Analyzing the log, it's evident that the spacecraft struggles with excessive horizontal velocity, high descent speed, and angular instability, culminating in a severe crash. Here are some key observations and necessary corrections to the code:

### Observations:
1. **High Initial Descent Speed**: The spacecraft has a substantial Y velocity early, necessitating immediate and sustained adjustments to slow down.
2. **Uncontrolled Angular Motion**: Angle values become problematic, indicating inadequate corrections.
3. **Late Reactions**: The spacecraft does not adjust promptly to out-of-control velocities and angles, exacerbating the instability.

### Modifications to the Algorithm:
1. **Immediate Descent Control**: Introduce a robust mechanism to continually manage Y velocity until it reaches safe thresholds.
2. **Stronger Angular Corrections**: Apply relentless adjustments for any angular deviations observed.
3. **Quick Horizontal Adjustments**: Proactively counteract horizontal drifts to keep X position centered, balancing well between left and right corrections.
4. **Hierarchical Action Priority**: Sequentially prioritize maintaining a stable angle, then descent speed, followed by horizontal position stability, ensuring preemptive and continuous corrections.

### Revised Code Implementation:
Next, we'll update the `act` function to follow these enhanced priorities:

Razonamiento:
Analyzing the log, the spacecraft shows issues in handling both X and Y velocities and maintaining a stable angle. Here are several key observations and necessary adjustments to the code:

### Observations:
1. **Poor Descent Control**: Initial actions show consistent negative points from incorrect descent speed control.
2. **Angular Stability**: Angle deviations remain problematic, indicating insufficient or delayed adjustments.
3. **Reactive Horizontal Adjustments**: Horizontal drift corrections are reactive rather than proactive, leading to instability.
4. **Ineffective Action Sequencing**: Action priorities may not be adequately addressing immediate critical issues.

### Modifications to the Algorithm:
1. **Continuous Descent Control**: Implement a stricter control for Y velocity by using the center engine more dynamically.
2. **Proactive Angular Adjustments**: Ensure the spacecraft makes proactive adjustments for any angular deviations right from the initial stages.
3. **Sequential Horizontal Adjustments**: Ensure horizontal corrections are balanced and preemptive when drift exceeds threshold values.
4. **Hierarchical Action Priority**: Prioritize maintaining a stable angle first, followed by managing descent speed, and then correcting horizontal drift continually.

### Revised Code Implementation:
Revising the `act` function with a stricter control and sequential priorities to ensure immediate response to critical deviations:

Razonamiento:
The log analysis reveals that the spacecraft experiences significant challenges in controlling its descent speed, horizontal position, and angle stability, ultimately leading to a crash. Here are the key observations and changes needed:

### Observations:
1. **Descent Speed Control:** The spacecraft consistently fails to reduce its descent speed, leading to dangerous velocities close to the ground.
2. **Angle Stability:** The angle drifts significantly, indicating inadequate corrective actions.
3. **Horizontal Position Control:** The spacecraft's horizontal position drifts extensively, showing inadequate correction for sideways movement.

### Modifications to the Algorithm:
1. **Aggressive Descent Control:** Reduce the threshold for activating vertical thrust to slow the descent more effectively.
2. **Immediate and Continuous Angular Adjustments:** Ensure quick and sustained corrections for any angular deviation from the vertical.
3. **Preemptive Horizontal Corrections:** Apply corrections before significant drift occurs to keep the spacecraft centered.
4. **Sequential Priority Adjustment:** Prioritize maintaining a stable angle first, controlling the descent speed second, and correcting horizontal drift third.

### Revised Code Implementation:
The following updates the `act` function to ensure the spacecraft prioritizes an aggressive and immediate response to critical deviations in descent speed, angle, and horizontal position:

Analyze the performance of the spacecraft and how it differs from the desired result. Be guided by the scoring system. Identify the cause of errors in your code and modify it without fear of making major changes. Think deeply about the priorities of your code and how to order and combine them correctly to achieve success. Remember that the code is a reflection of your reasoning and the way you approach the problem.

I'll start by examining each parameter in the logs:\n\n1. **X position**: This represents the horizontal distance of the spacecraft from the landing zone. The closer this value is to 0, the better aligned the spacecraft is with the desired landing area.\n\n2. **Y position**: This indicates the vertical height of the spacecraft above the landing area. The goal is to reduce this value to 0 gently for a smooth landing.\n\n3. **X velocity**: The horizontal speed of the spacecraft. A value close to 0 is ideal to avoid lateral movement during landing.\n\n4. **Y velocity**: The vertical speed of the spacecraft. A slower descent (negative value close to 0) is preferable for a soft landing.\n\n5. **Angle**: The tilt of the spacecraft. For a successful landing, this value should be as close to 0 as possible, indicating the spacecraft is upright.\n\n6. **Angular velocity**: How fast the spacecraft's angle is changing. Minimizing this is essential to maintain stability.\n\n7. **Left contact sensor with landing zone**: Indicates if the left side is in contact with the landing zone (1 if true, otherwise 0).\n\n8. **Right contact sensor with landing zone**: Indicates if the right side is in contact with the landing zone (1 if true, otherwise 0).\n\n### Action Effects\n\n- **Switch off engines (0)**: The spacecraft will be affected by gravity and may drift due to existing velocities.\n- **Push left engine (1)**: This will apply a force to the right and may correct left drift (affecting X position/velocity and angle).\n- **Push both engines (2)**: This reduces the Y velocity for a softer landing but consumes more fuel.\n- **Push right engine (3)**: This will apply force to the left, can correct right drift, and adjust the angle.\n\n### Steps to Achieve a Successful Landing\n1. **Initial Descent Control**: Use the central engine to control the descent speed (Y velocity).\n2. **Horizontal Alignment**: Apply left/right engines based on the X position and X velocity to align with the landing zone.\n3. **Angle Stabilization**: Ensure the angle is close to 0 using the left/right engines to correct any tilt.\n4. **Final Approach**: Continuously monitor descent speed, horizontal position, and angle. Adjust as needed to ensure a smooth landing.\n5. **Touchdown**: Ensure both contact sensors are activated with minimal X and Y velocities, and angle close to 0.\n\nI will implement these ideas into the 'act' function ensuring it makes decisions based on the current state observations to maximize the landing score.", "code": "def act(logs):\n    final_decision = []\n    for log in logs:\n        x_pos, y_pos, x_vel, y_vel, angle, ang_vel, left_contact, right_contact = log['current status']\n        action = 0  # Default to switching off engines\n\n        if left_contact == 1 and right_contact == 1:\n            # Safe landing condition met\n            action = 0\n        else:\n            # Control descent speed\n            if y_vel < -0.5:\n                action = 2  # Push both engines to slow down descent\n\n            # Correct horizontal alignment\n            if x_pos < -0.1:\n                action = 3  # Push right engine to move left\n            elif x_pos > 0.1:\n                action = 1  # Push left engine to move right\n\n            # Correct tilt\n            if angle < -0.1:\n                action = 3  # Push right engine\n            elif angle > 0.1:\n                action = 1  # Push left engine\n\n        final_decision.append(action)\n    return final_decision", "filename": "Action.py"}

To achieve a successful landing in the given environment, I will break down the observations from the logs and understand the impact of each action on the spacecraft's behavior. I'll start by examining each parameter in the logs:

1. **X position**: This represents the horizontal distance of the spacecraft from the landing zone. The closer this value is to 0, the better aligned the spacecraft is with the desired landing area.

2. **Y position**: This indicates the vertical height of the spacecraft above the landing area. The goal is to reduce this value to 0 gently for a smooth landing.

3. **X velocity**: The horizontal speed of the spacecraft. A value close to 0 is ideal to avoid lateral movement during landing.

4. **Y velocity**: The vertical speed of the spacecraft. A slower descent (negative value close to 0) is preferable for a soft landing.

5. **Angle**: The tilt of the spacecraft. For a successful landing, this value should be as close to 0 as possible, indicating the spacecraft is upright.

6. **Angular velocity**: How fast the spacecraft's angle is changing. Minimizing this is essential to maintain stability.

7. **Left contact sensor with landing zone**: Indicates if the left side is in contact with the landing zone (1 if true, otherwise 0).

8. **Right contact sensor with landing zone**: Indicates if the right side is in contact with the landing zone (1 if true, otherwise 0).

### Action Effects

- **Switch off engines (0)**: The spacecraft will be affected by gravity and may drift due to existing velocities.
- **Push left engine (1)**: This will apply a force to the right and may correct left drift (affecting X position/velocity and angle).
- **Push both engines (2)**: This reduces the Y velocity for a softer landing but consumes more fuel.
- **Push right engine (3)**: This will apply force to the left, can correct right drift, and adjust the angle.

### Steps to Achieve a Successful Landing
1. **Initial Descent Control**: Use the central engine to control the descent speed (Y velocity).
2. **Horizontal Alignment**: Apply left/right engines based on the X position and X velocity to align with the landing zone.
3. **Angle Stabilization**: Ensure the angle is close to 0 using the left/right engines to correct any tilt.
4. **Final Approach**: Continuously monitor descent speed, horizontal position, and angle. Adjust as needed to ensure a smooth landing.
5. **Touchdown**: Ensure both contact sensors are activated with minimal X and Y velocities, and angle close to 0.

I will implement these ideas into the 'act' function ensuring it makes decisions based on the current state observations to maximize the landing score.

The error trace suggests that the structure and delivery of the action values to the environment are incorrect. Instead of processing actions for multiple logs at once, the function should process each log step-by-step and return a single action per call to align with the environment's requirements. I will simplify the method to process one log entry and decide the appropriate action, expecting the environment to call this method multiple times, once per step.

Analyze the performance of the spacecraft and how it differs from the desired result. Be guided by the scoring system. Identify the cause of errors in your code and modify it without fear of making major changes. Think deeply about the priorities of your code and how to order and combine them correctly to achieve success. Remember that the code is a reflection of your reasoning and the way you approach the problem.

Razonamiento:
The log indicates that the default action of switching off the engines (action = 0) was used throughout the landing attempt, resulting in the spaceship accelerating downwards uncontrollably. Consequently, the deceleration needed to ensure a soft landing wasn't applied, leading to high vertical velocity (-1.79) and resulting in a crash. The key requirements to ensure a successful landing are:
1. **Control Descent Speed**: Use action 2 (central engine) to manage the vertical speed.
2. **Adjust Horizontal Position**: Use actions 1 or 3 (left or right engines) to correct horizontal position and velocity.
3. **Maintain Upright Angle**: Use actions 1 or 3 to stabilize the angle of the spacecraft.
4. **Consider Priority Order**: Prioritize deceleration if speed is too high, then position, then angle.
5. **Iterative Action Decisions**: Continuously check and update actions based on current state to meet these criteria.

### Revised Code Implementation with Priority Order:

1. **Descent Speed Control**: Apply action 2 if vertical speed is high.
2. **Horizontal Position Check**: Correct horizontal drift using actions 1 or 3.
3. **Angle Correction**: Ensure spacecraft remains upright using actions 1 or 3.

Every decision will consider these aspects iteratively to maximize the chances of a successful landing with a score exceeding 200 points.

Analyze the performance of the spacecraft and how it differs from the desired result. Be guided by the scoring system. Identify the cause of errors in your code and modify it without fear of making major changes. Think deeply about the priorities of your code and how to order and combine them correctly to achieve success. Remember that the code is a reflection of your reasoning and the way you approach the problem.

Razonamiento:
The logs show that the spacecraft continued to descend without deceleration, indicating that the downward motion was not sufficiently countered. This behavior suggests an issue in the prioritization of actions within the code. Despite the vertical speed criteria (y_vel < -0.5) being present, the action was set incorrectly. The decreasing scores indicate that the vertical velocity kept increasing, leading to a crash landing with a substantial negative score.

## Key Observations and Required Adjustments:
1. **Descent Speed Control**: The main priority. Ensure the vertical speed is regulated properly using action 2 (central engine).
2. **Horizontal Position**: Needs adjustment to keep alignment with the landing pad, but not at the expense of vertical speed control.
3. **Angle**: Stabilize only when vertically and horizontally stable.

New Prioritization Strategy:
1. Control vertical descent speed first to ensure it is within safe limits.
2. Adjust the horizontal position while maintaining vertical stability.
3. Adjust angle for proper alignment after vertical and horizontal corrections.

### Revised Code to Reflect Proper Prioritization:
1. Prioritize descent speed control when it exceeds safe values.
2. Correct horizontal drift based on position and velocity.
3. Adjust angle if descent and horizontal drift are within acceptable limits.

Analyze the performance of the spacecraft and how it differs from the desired result. Be guided by the scoring system. Identify the cause of errors in your code and modify it without fear of making major changes. Think deeply about the priorities of your code and how to order and combine them correctly to achieve success. Remember that the code is a reflection of your reasoning and the way you approach the problem.

Razonamiento:
The logs show that the 'act' function did not engage the engines at all, resulting in a crash due to the increasing vertical velocity. The default action (0) was applied throughout the landing attempt, leading to the spacecraft accelerating downwards uncontrollably. The spacecraft needs to engage the central engine (action 2) to slow its descent and use the left (1) and right (3) engines to adjust horizontal position and angle.

### Revised Priorities:
1. **Descent Speed Control**: Prioritize reducing the descent speed using the central engine (action 2).
2. **Horizontal Position**: Adjust using the side engines (actions 1 and 3).
3. **Angle Correction**: Ensure angle is maintained using the side engines (actions 1 and 3).

### Steps to Implement:
1. Continuously monitor and adjust the vertical speed first.
2. If descent speed is within a safe limit, correct horizontal position.
3. Finally, stabilize the angle.

I will revise and simplify the code to logically follow these priorities and ensure actions are applied correctly.

Analyze the performance of the spacecraft and how it differs from the desired result. Be guided by the scoring system. Identify the cause of errors in your code and modify it without fear of making major changes. Think deeply about the priorities of your code and how to order and combine them correctly to achieve success. Remember that the code is a reflection of your reasoning and the way you approach the problem.

Razonamiento:
Let's first break down the logs and the effects of each action on the current state observations:

# Log Schema Breakdown:
- 'time': Shows the current time step within the landing attempt.
- 'action': Indicates the action taken by the spacecraft.
  - 0: Switch off engines
  - 1: Push left engine
  - 2: Push both engines (upwards)
  - 3: Push right engine
- 'current status': The state of the spacecraft after the action.
  - X position: Horizontal position relative to the landing zone.
  - Y position: Vertical position relative to the landing zone.
  - X velocity: Horizontal velocity.
  - Y velocity: Vertical velocity.
  - Angle: The orientation of the spacecraft (left negative, right positive).
  - Angular velocity: The rate of change of the angle.
  - Left contact sensor: If the left side is in contact with the landing zone.
  - Right contact sensor: If the right side is in contact with the landing zone.
- 'score': The score received for the action taken at that time step.

# Effects of Actions on Current State Observations:
- Action 0: Maintains the current trajectory with no additional thrust.
- Action 1: Pushes the spacecraft left, affecting the X position, angle, and velocities.
- Action 2: Pushes the spacecraft upwards, affecting X velocity, Y velocity, and angle slightly.
- Action 3: Pushes the spacecraft right, affecting the X position, angle, and velocities.

# Steps to Achieve a Successful Landing:
1. Stabilize the spacecraft's angle to be close to zero to avoid tilt penalty and control horizontal movement.
2. Minimize horizontal velocity (X velocity) to ensure a vertical descent.
3. Constantly adjust vertical velocity (Y velocity) to ensure a soft landing.
4. Refrain center engine usage unless necessary as it carries a higher score penalty.
5. Ensure the spacecraft touches down with minimal velocity without tilting to avoid a crash.

# Strategy Implementation:
- Use left and right engines to adjust horizontal position and stabilize angle.
- Use upward thrust when needed to control vertical velocity.
- Attempt to maintain a balanced descent vector, ensuring minimal horizontal movement near the landing area.
- Regularly check current status to make precise decisions on engine usage.

We will now implement the 'act' method in 'Action.py' with the reasoning above. We’ll ensure the spacecraft’s landing score exceeds 200 points and avoid crashes at all costs.

Razonamiento:
From the logs, it’s clear that the spacecraft landed hard due to excessive lateral movement and high vertical velocity. After analyzing the logs and the initial reasoning, I’ll refine the approach to more accurately control the spacecraft’s descent.

Issues Observed:
1. Excessive reliance on the right engine (action 3) causing lateral acceleration and velocity buildup.
2. Insufficient vertical velocity control leading to a hard landing.
3. Angular stabilization logic was not adequately addressing build-up in horizontal momentum.
4. Lack of timely vertical thrust adjustments to counteract falling speed.

Key Adjustments Needed:
1. Prioritize vertical control to ensure a slow, controlled descent even if it incurs some score penalty due to the center engine usage.
2. Reduce excessive use of lateral thrust to prevent build-up of horizontal velocity.
3. Use lateral engines to correct horizontal motion only when a deviation threshold is crossed.
4. Continuously stabilize the angle to maintain an upright descent posture.

Steps to Follow for a Successful Landing:
1. Stabilize the angle to close to zero minimizing tilt and angular velocity.
2. Continuously monitor and adjust vertical velocity to ensure a slow descent.
3. Minimize horizontal velocity to approach the landing area vertically.
4. Apply corrections to horizontal drift sparingly to avoid excessive lateral movement.
5. Default: Use minimal engine to facilitate a stable descent.

Razonamiento:
The spacecraft’s logs indicate that it persisted with high vertical and horizontal velocity while also losing control over its angle. Despite attempts to manage the angle and stabilize along the axes, the use of up thrust was inconsistent, and control corrections were either too frequent or insufficient.

Issues Detected:
1. Imbalanced thrust leading to excessive lateral movement and high velocities.
2. Vertical control was lacking and led to hard descent.
3. Angular stabilization was done independently of velocity and position control resulting in conflicting actions.
4. Insufficient vertical thrust management during rapid descent phases.

Key Changes Needed:
1. Implement a balance in thrust actions to handle horizontal and vertical movements coherently.
2. Introduce more frequent evaluations of vertical velocity to better manage descent rate.
3. Coordinate angular thrust with horizontal motion correction.
4. Make a distinction in minor deviations and high-velocity corrections to adjust response actions.

Refined Approach:
- Angle, horizontal and vertical velocities have to be stabilized in conjunction to ensure a steady and controlled descent.
- Implement thresholds for responses to ensure minor deviations are adjusted without overcorrection.
- Prioritize slow, controlled vertical descent even if some score penalties occur through heavier use of upwards thrust.

Analyze the performance of the spacecraft and how it differs from the desired result. Be guided by the scoring system. Identify the cause of errors in your code and modify it without fear of making major changes. Think deeply about the priorities of your code and how to order and combine them correctly to achieve success. Remember that the code is a reflection of your reasoning and the way you approach the problem.

Razonamiento:
The spacecraft's performance indicates several significant issues despite minor improvements. Here's a detailed analysis:

1. **Angle and Angular Velocity Control:** The craft shifts between actions to stabilize angle but fails to address persistent high angular velocity, which was negatively impacting scores despite small corrections.

2. **Horizontal Position and Velocity:** The craft frequently oscillates between thrusts to correct horizontal position, creating lack of steady control over the landing path, and contributing to excessive lateral movements.

3. **Vertical Velocity Control:** Vertical velocity remains high; the craft does not slow its descent adequately, resulting in hard landings or crashes.

4. **Thrust Strategy:** The scoring logs show excessive reliance on corrective thrusts without achieving stable descent or maintaining a controlled trajectory, further exacerbated by frequent engine switches.

Key Observations for Improvement:
1. **Vertical Descent:** Prioritize maintaining a slow, controlled vertical descent, even with incremental corrections compared to erratic thrust changes.
2. **Angular Corrections:** Handle angle corrections synchronously with horizontal drift to avoid further compounding the errors in control adjustments.
3. **Lateral Stability with Minimal Engine Adjustments:** Reduce oscillations by setting a small threshold for positional corrections and maintaining steadiness without rapid engine switching.
4. **Proactive Descent Slowdown:** Ensure use of upward thrust gradually to manage descent rate, slowing sufficiently near the landing zone.

Revised Code Strategy:
1. Focus on balanced approach controlling vertical and horizontal velocities before adjustments with angle corrections.
2. Implement incremental descent strategy ensuring gradual reduction in velocity aiding smooth touchdown.
3. Use positional & velocity thresholds for minimal corrective adjustment points ensuring smooth control.

  "reasoning": "From the latest logs, it's clear that the spacecraft is suffering from high vertical and horizontal velocities and inadequate control over its angle.

Razonamiento:
From the latest logs, it's clear that the spacecraft is suffering from high vertical and horizontal velocities and inadequate control over its angle. Despite earlier minor improvements, the over-reliance on emergency adjustments and lack of sustained stable descent resulted in failure. Here are the key issues and steps for modification:

1. **Excessive Use of Central Engine:** This leads to depletion of score due to higher penalties.
2. **Poor Vertical Control:** The vertical descent rate was not maintained at an optimal level, leading to hard landings or crashes.
3. **Horizontal Drift:** The oscillations and corrections for horizontal movement were not effective in reducing overall drift.
4. **Inadequate Angle Management:** The angle control was ineffective, especially during later stages, leading to severe tilts.

Proposed Strategy Adjustments: 
1. **Conservative Use of Central Engine:** Use the central engine sparingly strictly for decelerating rapid vertical descent to conserve score.
2. **Effective Vertical Descent Management:** Implement more frequent, smaller upward thrust adjustments to gradually control the vertical speed.
3. **Stable Horizontal Positioning:** Adjust horizontal corrections in smaller, more frequent steps to achieve better control and sustain stability.
4. **Balance Angle and Angular Velocity:** Continuously monitor and counter any angle deviations to maintain the spacecraft’s orientation.
